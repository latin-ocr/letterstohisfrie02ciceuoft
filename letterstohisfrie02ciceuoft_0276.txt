CICERO

te aliquam putes accipere3 etiam haec levior est plaga
8 ab amico, quam a debitore. Nec tamen eas. cenas
quaero, ut magnae reliquiae fiant ; quod erit, magni-
ficum sit et lautum. Memini te mihi Phameae ce-
nam narrare. Temperius fiat, cetera eodem modo.
Quod si perseveras me ad matris tuae cenam revo-
care, feram id quoque. Volo enim videre animum, qui
mihi audeat ista, quae scribis, apponere, aut etiam
polypum Miniati Iovis similem. Mihi crede, non
audebis. Ante meum adventum fama ad te de mea
nova lautitia veniet3 eam extimesces. Neque est, -
quod in promulside spei ponas aliquid ; quam totam
sustuli. Solebam enim antea debilitari oleis et lucani-
9 cis tuis. Sed quid haec loquimur ? Liceat modo isto
venire. Tu vero (volo enim abstergere animi tui
metum) ad tyrotarichum antiquum redi. Ego tibi
unum sumptum afferam, quod balneum calfacias opor·

θ According to one of Caesar’s laws‚ passed in 49, to
relieve the financial situation, creditors were compelled to
take in payment the lands of their debtors at the price they
would have fetched before the Civil War, that price bein
estimated by arbitrators, the lands so valued being call
aestimationem this involved an average loss to creditors‚
according to Suetonius, of 25 per cent. See note on v. 20. 9.

The gist of the whole passage from Tu autem seems to be
this ι “ It is no good your trying to get out of entertaining me
properly by pretending to ‘ file your petition.’ Why, when
you were we l off, you were stingier than ever. If you have
really suffered by Caesar’s financial law (it doae not seem to
have affected your spirits very much), why not regard the
expense of entertaining me as a mere item in your bank-
ruptcy (3’), and regarding it as an aestimatio (see above), a
‘ composition ' (as Shuckburgh translates it) offered you by
your detorfi? And after all 1 am not your debtor, but ⁴
yogrlfrrgffickly the uncle of Tigellius. See vii. 24. 2.
