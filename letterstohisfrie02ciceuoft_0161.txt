 

EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VIII. vm.

in desei-enee to you, very kindly made Vestorius
a present of it. ⁰

There is now also the following keenly disputed 2
case occupying the courts. ⁶ M. Servilius, having,
consistently with 1113 previous career, made an utter
mess of his affairs, and left nothing for anybody but
what was for sale, had been handed over to me as a
client of the worst possible reputation3 but Laterensis,
thepraetor,i11spite of the representations of Pausanias
(Ι being counsel for the defence), refused to take up
the' mquiry as to‘ ‘what had become of that money.
Then Q. Pilius, 3 connexion of our friend Atticus,
brought an action against Servilius for extortion.
Thai: immediately gave rise to a lot of gossip, and
people began to talk excitedly about a conviction.
This slant of wind casts up Appius the younger, to
’ give evidence that a sum of money out of his
father’ s &tate had found its way into Servilius’ s
pocket, and to allege that 81,000 sesterces had
been placed 1n 1113 hands for the purpose of bribing
the prosecution. You are surprised at 1113 want of
’ Claudius, who, 111 1113 disgust at Servilius’ 3 mismanagement
of affairs entrusted to him, gave evidence about the bribe
which seriously compromised‚ not only himself, but his
own father. ,9¹¹ this evidence Laterensis allowed the case

Servilius, but only recorded the verdicts of the separate
orders· and when Appius again a ppealed he said‘ he
would merely record the facts. ” Thus Servilius, being
neither acquitted nor condemned, is to be handed over to
Pilius, to whom Appius had given place, to be dealt with
on the charge of repetundao. And now Appius himself 13
being prosecuted for repetundae by Serv ilius and his relations,

and at the same time for vis (“ breach of the peace ”) by

one of his own agents, Sextus Tettius. (The. above is a
precis of the notoe of both Tyrrell and How.)
