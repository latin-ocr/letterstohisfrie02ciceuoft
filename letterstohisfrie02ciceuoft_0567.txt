Senate would easily have carried the day but for
the violent opposition of Pansa. Having made the

could about you in a ringing voice that filled the
forum, and the shouting and applause of the people
was—well, Ῑ never saw anything like it ! Ι hope you

Pansa stated in the public meefinggthat your mother δ
also and brother had objected to my making that
proposal. But an that lest me unmoved; Ι had
better things to think about. I was advocating the
public cause, which Ι have always advocated, and
your political position and prestige as well. .

But as to the question Ι discussed at considerable 2
length in the Senate, and as to what Ι said at the
public meeting, 1 should be glad if you would redeem
the pledge I gave. I promised and almost positively
asserted that you had not waited for nor would wait
for any decrees of ours, but would yourself defend the
constitution in your own good way3 and although
we have not yet heard anything as to your present
position, or the forces at your disposal, for all that
I take my stand on the fact that all the forces and
troops in your part of the world are yours, and that
it is through you I am assured that the province of
Asia has already been won back for the Republic.
Do your utmost to surpass yourself in enhancing your
own glory. Farewell.
