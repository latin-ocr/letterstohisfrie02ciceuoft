RPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XI. xxt.

whatever was in it. You have given me a signal
proof of your affection.

As for what that same Segulius told you, that the 2
veterans are complaining that you and Caoear are not

on the decemvirate‚⁰ Ι only wish Ι were not, either.

It is the greatest nuisance in the world. Anyhow,
when 1 had expressed my opinion that a vote ought
to be taken about the generals in command of armies,
the same old gang who always do so shouted me
down ; you two were therefore definitely lest out, in

swallowed down at a gulp.¹’

You write,however‚that you are doing for me what 3

you would not do for yourself—that is, having some
fear on my account ; well, Brutus, most excellent of

Ι shall make no false step, and as for what will admit
of no precautions, I do not worry myselfso very much

more than can be bestowed upon mortal man by
nature.

Your advice to me to be on my guard against being 4
forced by my fears to fear yet more, is the advice of 3
wise and very friendly man. But while all are agreed
as to your pre-eminence in that particular form of
fortitude which prevents your ever being afraid, or
even disconcerted, Ι would have you convince yourself

Α that Ι too approximate very nearly to that fortitude

 

of yours 3 and for that reason, while dreading nothing,
