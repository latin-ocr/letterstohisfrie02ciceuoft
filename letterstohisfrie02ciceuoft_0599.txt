seinai, or who was to blame for its having happened,
and report to you on the whole matter.

Meanwhile as I was on my voyage to Asia by the 2
island route‚⁸ having received news that Dolabella‘s

“ fleet was off Lycia, and that the Rhodians had several

ships fully equipped and ready afloat, with those ships
which 1 had either brought with me, or which hadbeen
collected by Patiscus⁶ the proquaestor‚ a man very
closely bound to me by persona] ties as well as by his
politicalsenfiments,1returnedto Rhodes‚relying upon
your authority and the decree of the Senate, whereby
youhadpronounced Dolabella apublic enemy, and also
on the treaty which had been renewed with them in
the consulship of M. Marcellus and Servius Sulpicius,⁶

In that Ι was bitterly disappointed, for so far from

and that with that object in view certain cargo—ships‚
