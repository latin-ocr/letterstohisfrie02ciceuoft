EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XI. xv.—xvi.

foi-ward to a letter from you with intense eagerness‚
and such a letter too as Ι most earnestly desire.

CICERO ΊῸ 'rm-2 SAME

Rome, May or June, 43 κιο.

sse time at which this letter is put into your hands l
is of paramount importance, whether it is when you
have some anxiety on your mind, or when you are free
from all annoyance. I have therefore instrueted the
person whom I have sent to you to watch his time for
the delivery of the letter. You know that, just as in
personal interviews those who approach us at an un-
favourable moment are often an annoyance, so letters
boo are a cause of offence, if delivered inopportunely.
If however (and I hope it is so), you have nothing to
disturb, nothing to embarrass you, and my messenger
has been elever and tactful enough in choosing the
moment to approach you, Ι feel sure I shall have no
difficulty in getting you to do what I desire.

There is no man living with whom I am on more
intimate terms. There is a long—standing friendship
and a close intimacy between us ; and (what weighs
most with me) nothing delights me more than my
constant intercourse with him. Moreover‚ I am
under an obligation to him for his great kindness and
great good services. In the Clodian days, when he
was head of the equestrian order ὓ and was fighting

ordinis). Under the Empire he was called princeps iuven-
tutis, and the post was generally held by the heir to the throne.
