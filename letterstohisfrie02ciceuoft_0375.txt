the Senate.

As to yourself, though you are not lacking in 2
discretiom or, Ι should rather say, possess it in

think it incumbent upon you to consult the Senate.

path is indicated by your consideration for the public

welfare. Make a special point of letting us hear

of some brilliant exploit on your part, before we

ever expected it to happen. This Ι promise you,

that whatever your achievement, the Senate will

heartily applaud it as a proof, not only of your
³* loyalty‚ but also of your wisdom.
