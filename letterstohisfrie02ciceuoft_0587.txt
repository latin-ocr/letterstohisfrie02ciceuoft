and to prevent his getting it will be an easy business

Having called upon our friend Brutus, and find· 1
ing that he would be somewhat late in coming to
Asia, I returned to Asia myself, to collect the arrears
of my business and send the money to Rome as soon
as possible. Meantime I learnt that Dolabella’s
fleet was off Lycia, and over a hundred ships of
burden, on which his army might be embarked ; and
that Dolabella‘s intention in collecting them had
been, if foiled in his hopes of Syria, to get on board

of these services he gives an account in this and the next
letter. Later he served inst Rhodes, and was in com-
mand of M in Lycia. ough he had no right to do so,
he persistesilm claiming a share in Caoear’s assassination‚
and was ultimately put to death, probably for that reason,
by Antony and Octavian. His literary style, as shown in
ὦδε letters, is remarkably good.
