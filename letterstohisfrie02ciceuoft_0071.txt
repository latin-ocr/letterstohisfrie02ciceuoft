CICERO TO THE SAME
Rome, February, 53 mc.

I was wondering why it was that you had stopped 1
writing to me. Well, my friend Pansa α has let it

ἱ out—you have turned Epicurean ! What a marvellous
¹1· camp ἰ What would you have done had I sent you,
, « not to Samarobriva, but to Tarentum ⁶ ? Ι felt there

ζ was something amiss with you, ever since you
⁷} supported the same views as my ffiend Selius.⁰ But 2

¹ howon earthwill you uphold the principles of civil law,

³ when your every act is for yourself alone and not for

, your fellow-citizens? Besides, what will become of the

¹ legal formula in cases of trust, that dealings between

hmst men should be in accordance with konesty ? For

2 who is an honest man, who does nothing except

what is to his own interest? What will be your

ξ legal ruling as to dividing what is held in common,
¹ when nothing can be held in common among those
whose one standard of conduct is their own pleasure ?

Again, how will you fancy swearing by Jupiter and
tloe Sume! when you know well enough that it is

ζ impossible for Jupiter to be angry with anybody?

 

What, moreover, will become of your people of
Ulubrae‚⁸ if you lay it down that it is improper to
