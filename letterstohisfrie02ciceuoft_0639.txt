EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. xxvi.

CICERO ΤΟ THE SAMB

Rome, in the spring of 43 mc.

Q. Turius,⁶ who has had banking business in Africa, 1

a sterling and honourable man, has made certain men
in the same line of business his heirs ; they are Cn.
Saturninus, Sex. Aufidius, C. Anneius, Q. Con-
sidius Gallus, L. Servilius Postumus, and C.
Rubellius. Ι understood from what they told me that
what they want is more a letter of thanks to you than
a reeommendation from me. For they declared
-that they had found you so remarkably genereus in
{flffffissessfflssdfflss 3¹:123&ss ἵζξῖθῖἰῖοᾞὲ «1Ἐῖ
to ask of you. I shall dare, nevertheless3 for I know 2
how much weight a recommendation of mine is likely
to carry. I therefore beg of you, in view of this
letter, to enhance the generosity you have already
shown without any letter from me by making as hand-
some an addition to it as you can. Now the head and
front of my recommendation is that you do not allow
Eros Turius, Q. Turius· s freedman, to convert to his
own uses, as he has hitherto done, t’he latter’ s legacy,
and that you should reg-ard these men in all other

raepeeoe as being most cordially commended by me.
You will derive much pleasure from their dis-
tinguished rank ⁶ and their respectful deference to
you. Ι earnestly beg you again and again to -be good
enough to do so.
