EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VII. xxm.

Anyhow, if Ι am to take over your purchases, Ι wish
you would notify me where they are, when they are
to be sent for, and in what kind of conveyance 3 for
if Damasippus has not the courage of his opinions,
Ι have got to find some soi-disant Damasippus,

’ even if I lose by it.

As to what you repeat in your letter about the
house, 1 had already, just as Ι was leaving home,
put the matter in the hands of my daughter Tullia ;
for that was the very hour Ι received your letter.

Ι had also conferred with your friend Nicias, since
he is intimate, as you know, with Cassius.“ On my

-A return, however, before Ι had read this last letter

of yours, Ι asked Tullia what she had done. She
told me she had dealt with the matter through
Licinia (though I fancy Cassius does not see so very
much of his sister), who in her turn declared that in
her husband’s absence (for Dexius had lest for Spain)
she had not the com-age to change her house, he not

⁷ only being absent, but knowing nothing about it.

Ι am very much pleased that you should have
valued your close association with me in my life and
mode of living so highly as, in the first place, to
choose a house where you could dwell, not only near,
but absolutely with me ; and secondly, to be in such
a mighty hurry to make the move. But Ι had sooner
die than admit that you are any more eager to see the
thing through than I am myself3 so Ι shall leave no
stone unturned ; for I see how important it is to me,
and indeed to both of us. If I have any success, Ι
shall make a point of letting you know. You will,
Ι am sure, reply by letter on every detail, and will
tell me, if you please‚ when Ι am to expect you.
