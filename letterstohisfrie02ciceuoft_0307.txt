 

EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. mv.

But really, my dear Paetus, joking apart, I advise 3

ᾗ, you to do what, in my opinion, has a direct bearing
ζ upon a happy life—to live with men who are good and

pleasant fellows, and fond of you. Life hae nothing

·’ better suited to it, there is nothing better adapted

to a life of happiness. And Ι do not base my argu-

⁴ ment on the plemres of the palate, but on the
enjoyment of life and living in common, and that
‚ relaxation of mind which is most effectively induced

by familiar conversation, and assumes its most

3 cham-ming form in convivial gatherings, as our fellow
' countrymen call them3 and they are wiser therein
r than the Greeks; they call them συμπόσια οι·
² σύνδειπνα, which is to say “ drinkings together ” or
's‘ “dinings together ’; me call them “livings to-

gether,” for then, more than ever, do our lives

coincide. You observe how I am trying to win
· you back to our dinners by philosophizing? Take
v care of your health, and the easiest way to ensure
,χ that is to make a practice of dimng out.

But, as you love me, take care you do not, because 4

. I writeinrather a jocular vein, suspect me of having
- thmwn to the winds my concern for the Republic.
v My dear Paetus, you may convince yourself of this,
³ Α that day and night, my one principle of action, my
· one anxiety, is to secure the safety and freedom of
fftfizssxxfsssszznsffiffxassg {ffiffikssssgffiffly

In short my spirit is such that, if in this my charge

and ministration I am called upon to lay down my
’ ἱ, life, 1 think Ι shall have accounted for myself not
Q without glory. Farewell again and again.
