To u. ramus GALLUS ⁶
Rome, 61 (?) mc.

1 had only just arrived from Arpinum when a letter l
. from you was delivered to me3 and by the same
ῖς hand Ι received one from Avianius? containing this
j very handsome offer, that when he came he would
’, enter my debt to him on whatever day I pleased.⁶
’ Pray put yourself in my place. Is it consistent with
. either your sense of honour or mine, first to haggle
about the day, and then to ask for more than a year’s
eredit? But everything would have been easy, my
dear Gallus, had you bought only what Ι wanted,
and that only up to the price Ι had in my mind.

But for all that, the actual purchases mentioned in
’ Ξέοῗ 1ng {¹ ζωῖἷᾚέἓέιᾎὲἓάιέξὲ y 53¹¹ sfifffi' 13¹3?
only your anxiety to please, but your affection also,
in buying up, because you considered them worthy
of me, things which gave pleasure to yourself, who,
as 1 have always thought, show most refined taste
wherever critical skill is needed.

Sfill I should like Damasippus& to stick to his 2
intention; for out of all your purchases there is
absolutely not one that I should really prize. You,
however, in ignorance of my regular practice, took
over your four or five statues at a price beyond
what Ι set on the whole collection of statues in the
world. You compare yourBacchantes with Metellus’s⁸
³ Muses. Where is the analogy ? In the first place,
