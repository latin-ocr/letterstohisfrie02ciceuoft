EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X. ΧΠ

1 remembered the promisce contained in the letters
you sent me, and thirdly, because I had been made
thoroughly acquainted with your pmposae by our
ffiend Furnius. But to the Senate your words
appeared to transcend all expectation ; not that it
had ever entertained a doubt of your good intentions,
but it had insufficient assurance either as to how much
you were able to do, or as to how far you were willing
ἐξ, when on the morning of April 7, M. Varisidius⁶ 2
had handed me your letter and I had read it, you
could not believe the ecstasy of my joy 3 and as 1
was being escorted from my house by a huge throng
of the most patriofic men and citizens, Ι immediately
made them all sharers in my happiness.

Meanwhile our friend Munatius ὓ paid me a visit,
as he often does. Well, Ι gave him your letter,
for up to that moment he had learnt nothing, I
being the first to whom Varisidius had come, saying
that such were your instructions to him. A little
later Munatius also gave me to read the private letter
you had sent to himself and the public despatch too.

We decided to lay the letter forthwith before 3
the City praetor Cornutus, who, in the absence of
the consuls, was, according to the traditional practice,
discharging the consular duties. The senate was
immediately convened, and there was a large
attendance owing to all the talk and the expecta-
tions roused by your despatch. After it had been
read ont, Cornutus was faced with a religious diffi-
culty, the pullarii ⁶ drawing his notice to the fact
that he had not attended with all due formality to
the auspicem and the irregularity was confirmed by
our college of augum, and so the business was put off
