Tusculum, about J uly 23, 46 mc.

Ι was at my Tusculum villa enjoying a holiday, l
ἶ because I had sent my pupils ⁰ to meet their particular
Α stiend,⁶ so that they might at the same time win his
ὲ favour as far as possible for myself too, when Ι re-
ceived your letter so brimful of charm. 1 gathered
.i from it that you approve my scheme—I mean my
- having begun, now that the law-courts have been
abolished, and I am no longer king of the Forum, to
keep a kind of school, just as Dionysius the tyrant,⁶
after his expulsion from Syracuse, is alleged to have
opened a school at Corinth.

There is no more to be said. I too am delighted 2
with the scheme, which gives me several advantages ς
j in the first place—and this is just now most necessary
—I am protecting myself against these dangerous
ᾗ days. What such protection may be worth, Ι do not
know. I only see that nobody so far has proposed
any plan that I prefer to this—unless perhaps it would
have been better to die. ‘⁸ In my bed? '’ Yes, I

gloriously. Well, it is open to me to do likewise
whenever I so please‚ provided only Ι do my best to
prevent its being as necessary for me to do so as it
was for him ; and that is just what I am doing. That
then is the first advantage. The next is this—1 3
myself am getting better, first as regards my heasth,
