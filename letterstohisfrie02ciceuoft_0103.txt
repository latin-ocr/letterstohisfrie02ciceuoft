Tusculum, August 20, 4-5 me.

Traces of your devotion to me at every turn! 1
Take the latest instance of all——the affair of Tigellius 3
for your letter made me feel that you had taken
infinite pains about it ; and Ι am accordingly
“ grateful for your kind thought sor me. But a
- word or two on that matter. It was Cipius? I
believe, who once said Ι am not asleep to every-
, body, so Ι, my dear Gallus, am not a slave to
everybody. And what, after all, does that slavery
amount to ? In the old days, when I was supposed
to be playing the king,⁰ I had no such deference
paid me by any people as is paid me at the present
moment by all the most intimate friends of Caesar,
with the exception of this person. I reckon it as so
much profit to be rid of a fellow who is even more
pesfflent than the country he comes from α ; and I
fancy he was effectually disposed of already as a job
lot by the Hipponactean advertisement of Calvus
Licinius, auctioneer.⁶

But observe the reason of his indignation. I had 2
undertaken Phamea’s defence, because he was
Phamea ; for he was on very familiar terms with me.
well, he came to me and said that the judge had
arranged to take his case on the very day on which the
jury had to consider their verdict in the case of P.
meti-e, so called because it was the iambie trimeter with a
spondee, instead of an iambic foot, at the end. Licinius’s

scazon was Sardi Tiyelci putidum caput venit, happily
rendered by Tyrrell “ For sale Tigellius, the Sardinian oaf.’'
