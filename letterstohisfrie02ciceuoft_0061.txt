EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VII. vnn-11

emmo 'ro 'mn suu:
Rome, August, 54 n-c.
Caesar tells me in a most courteous letter that 1

ζ owing to his being so busy you are not yet as intimate

with him as he could wish, but that you certainly will
.· be so. I told him in my reply how grateful Ι should
be ff he bestowed upon you all the consideration, kind-

ness, and liberality he could. But in your own letter 1
discovered a certain excess of hastiness on your part,
while at the same time I wondered why you disdained
the advantages of a tribuneship‚ especially with
exemption from military duties.

1 shall complain of you to Vacerra⁰ and Manilius‚⁶
for Ι dare not say a word to Cornelius,¹’ whose
reputation you have endangered by your folly,
3303? ἒῦἓῗῗοῖᾚξ {31²3 &332⁰ 3¹30}ssAEssss
and opportunity. Ρ You will never fissd a better.
You refer* m your letter to that great jurist, Precianus;
well, I never cease recommending you to him,
particularly as he writes to me himself that you owe
> him some expression of gratitude. Mind you let me
know what it is all about. I am on the look· out for
letters from yourself and the others m Britain.

CICERO '1³0 'rm-3 SAME
Rome, October, 54 B. c.

It is long since I heard how you are; you never 1
write, and I have not written to you ’for the last
