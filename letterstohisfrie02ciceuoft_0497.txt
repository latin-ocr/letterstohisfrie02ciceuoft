Rome, end of May, 43 mc.

You would be surprised, my dear Brutus, how 1
delighted Ι am that my plans and proposals as to the
decemvirate ¹² and doing honour to the young Caesar,
meet with your approval. But what matters it?
Believe me (and I am not given to talking big), Ι am
now absolutely paralysed, Brutus ; the tool I worked
with was the Senate, and that tool is now in pieces.
Your brilliant sally from Mutina, and the flight of
Antony after his army had been cut to pieces, had
brought us such high hopes of an assured victory, that
we are all suffering from a nervous reaction, and those
vehement harangues of mine seem mere phantom-

Bltlltlgto return to business, those who know them 2
declare that in no circumstances whatever can the
Martian‘ and the Fourth legion be brought over to
you. As to the money of which you feel the lack,
measures to raise it can be, and will be, taken. As to
sending for Βωῐιιε,α and keeping Caesar to guard
Italy, Ι heartily agree with you. But, as you write,
you have your detractors; myself, Ι parry them with
the utmost ease, · but for all that they are a hindrance.
We are expecting the legions from Africa.

But the recrudescence of the war where you are is a 3
matter of general surprise. Never was anything less

Lepidus (who had married his sister), so he turned a deas ear
to Cicero s advice and entreatioe. '’ W. W. How, Introd.
