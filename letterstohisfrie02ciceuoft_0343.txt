as it seems, in the establishment of a reputation3
but Ι have controlled myself until I could succeed
so far in my undertakings as to achieve something
worthy both of the consulship in store for me, and
the expectations of all of you. And that 1 hope,

protection to the commonwealth. I beg you to
support with your interest my position in the State,
and to stimulate my activity in the future by letting

Be sure to keep well, and to love me as Ι love you.
