CICERO

iam audieram fremitum clientium meorum, quos qui-
dem tu mihi conciliasti. Nam Ulubris honoris mei
causa vim maximam ranunculorum se commosse
constabat. Cura, ut valeas. vl. Idus April. de
Pomptino.

conscidi innocentem 3 nihil enim habebat, quod non
vel in contione recte legi posset. Sed et Arruntius

CICERO TREBATIO S.
Rhegii, ΛΑΜ). 710. ⁴

Vide, quanti apud me sis3 etsi iure id quidem3
non enim te amore vinco. Verumtamen quod prae-
senti tibi prope subnegaram, non tribueram certe, id
absenti debere non potui. Itaque, ut primum Velia

⁶ Trebatius was patronus of Ulubrae, and during his
absence had left Cicero in charge of his clients there. Being
near the Pomptine marshes, Ulubrae was overrun with
frogs, and Cicero pretends that they were the clients Tre-
batius had made over to him.

⁶ He refers to the great rising in Gaul in 54 and 53, and
the second expedition across the Rhine.

⁶ Cicero, disgusted with the state of affairs under Antony,
is now on his way to Goeece, and sends this letter (dated
eight days later than the next) from Rhegium on the coast
of Bruttium, whither he had sailed from Velia in Lucania,
where Trebatius had a house, occupied by Cicero in his
absence.
