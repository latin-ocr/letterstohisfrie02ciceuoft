EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VII. 11.

Now Ι want you to believe me when Ι say that 1
derived more delight from this trial than from the
death of my enemy:¹ For in the first place, Ι had
rather win in a court of law than by the sword, and
secondl by bringing about the triumph rather
than the litical downfall of a fiiend.⁶ And Ι was
above all delighted that the enthusiasm of honest men
on my behalf stood out so conspicuously to resist
the inconceivably strenuous efforts of a most dis-
tinguished and powerful personage!
Lastly (perhaps you will think it hardly probable) 3
1 hated this man much worse than Ι hated the
notorious Clodius himself; for the latter I had
attacked, the former Ι had defended!³ And Clodius,
when the whole State was likely to be jeopardized
fflzsss‘ffi flssidfllfflatffi, ffiffssssffffissgas'ffiiaffi‘}
of those who could not stand firm as long as I did so ;
but this little ape of a fellow, just by way of amusing
himself, had picked me out to be the object of his
attacks, and had convinced some of my ill-wishers
that he would always be at hand to let loose upon me.
So Ι bid you rejoice right heartily ; it has been a
great achievement. Never have any of my fellow-
citizens shown greater courage than those who dated
to condemn him, and defy the enormous resources of
the man by whom the jurors themselves had been
chosen. This they would neverhave done had they
not made my grievance their own.
Here I am so distracted by the number of cases, 4

and the crowded state of the law-coum, and by the
new legislation‚⁶ that Ι offer prayers daily that there

may be no intercalary month,t so that Ι may see you
as soon as possible.
