EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. v1.
VI

CICERO ΤΟ THE SAME
Rome, the latter half of June, 46 B.c.

Our friend Caninius gave me your message, re- l
minding me to write and tell you if there were any-
thing which I considered you ought to know. Well
then, his arrival—I mean Caesar's—-is being eagerly
awaited, and of that you are well aware yourself.
However on his writing, as Ι believe, that he would
come to his villa at Alsium, his friends wrote and
told him not to do so; many people there would,
they said, be an annoyance to him, and he to many;
it looked as if it might be more convenient for him
to land at Ostia. I do not see myself what differ-
ence it makes. And yet Hirtius told me that he
himself and Balbus and Oppius had all three written
· to him to do so—-men who are, as I am well assured,
devoted to you.

Ι wished you to be informed of this 111 order that 2
you might know where to prepare quarters for your-
self, or rather that you might do so in both places3
- for it is uncertain what he will do 3 and incidentally
Ι have clearly shown you that Ι am on intimate terms
with those men and share their counsels‚ · and I see
110 reason why 1 should be indisposed to do so. For
to bear what must be borne is not at all the same
thing as to approve what must not be approved.
Though indeed, what I should‘ ‘not appi-ove ’' I
don’ t now know, except the first beginnings of the
business3 for they depended on voluntary choice. ⁶
I saw—you, of course, were abroad—that while our
ffiends desired war, Caesar did not so much desire it
