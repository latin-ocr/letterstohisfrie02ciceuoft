EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. xxix.

Rome, is aware of my intimate friendship with L.
Lamias· Indeed it was exhibited on a world-wide
stage at the time when he was banished by the consul
Gabinius, on the grounds that he had advocated my
restoration with independence and courage. And it
was not from that incident that our mutual affection

affected your political position—Lamia, who was never

the decrees of the Senate deposited at that time were
