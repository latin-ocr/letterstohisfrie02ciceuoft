EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VII. 111.—1v.

be a State, Ι ain a citizen of it, if not, that Ι am an
exile in a place not less convenient than if Ι had
betaken myself to Rhodes or Mitylene.

Ι should have preferred discussing these matters 6
with you in person; but because time was getting
on, I determined to convey the same sentiments to
you by letter, so that you might know what to say if
ever you fell among my detractorS. For there are
people who, though my passing away was not likely
to be of the slightest benefit to the Republic, look
upon it as a sort of scandalous reflection upon me
that Ι am still alive. Now these people, Ι am quite
sure, are not satisfied with the many who have already
fallen ; people who, had they but listened to me, would
at any rate be living an honourable life, however
harsh the terms of peace ; for inferior as they were in
arms, they would not have been so in the justice of
their cause.

Well, there’s a letter for you, rather more wordy
perhaps than you would have liked ; and Ι shall think
that it seems so to you, unless you send me a longer
one in reply. If I can settle some business Ι want
done, Ι shall see you, I hope, before very long.
