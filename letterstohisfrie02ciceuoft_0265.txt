EPISI'ULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. xv.

first of lentium, at ,the time when provincialism

‘³ trane of the fine old style of pleasantry is to be seen.⁶

And so, whenever 1 meet you, Ι seem in very truth
to meet all the Granii,⁶ all the Lucilii? yes, and the
Crassi· too and the Laelii.⁸ May Ι dieis I can find

ς a single sou] lest, except yourself, in whom Ι can
Τ recognize any resemblance to the ancient and indi-
genous jocularity. When to these flashffi of wit is
ἶ added the sincere affection you have for me, do you
2- wonder that Ι was so frightened to death at your
” being so prostrated by ill-health ?

As to your apology in your second letter to the 3
effect that you did not oppose my purchasing a house

’ἵζ’ at Naplae, but only suggested caution, you put it very
nicely, and that is just how Ι took it; at the same
ζ’ time 1 understood, what Ι also understand from

your last letter, that in your opinion Ι have no right

to do what Ι thought I might do, that is, to abandon

politics here, not indeed altogether, but to a great
extent. You quote Catulus s against me, and all

those times. Ι fail to see the analogy. Why, Ι

myself had no inclination in those days to withdraw

, for any length of time from the guardianship of the
”· Republic ; for Ι was seated on the poop, and held the
ἐς tiner, but now there is hardly room for me where
ζ, the bilge-water is!

Do you really think that there will be fewer decrees 4
as consul in 78 raeisted his seditious colleague Lepidus, and

· later opposed the bestowing of extraordinary wers upon
ο

s Pompey. In 63 he voted

r the execution o the Catilin-

anans. He died in 60 mc.
