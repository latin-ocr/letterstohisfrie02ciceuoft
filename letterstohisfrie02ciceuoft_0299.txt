EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. xxn.

η’ ms is among the obscenitiae. “ Yes, but the famous

Frugi⁰ complains in his Annals that youths are

ξ given up to the penis.” What you in your letter call

by its own name? he with more reserve calls pems 3

¹· but because many people use it so, it has become as
’ἦ obscene as the word you used. What of the common
‚ expression Cum nos te voluimus convenire ⁶—is that
Ξ obscene? 1 remember an eloquent consular using
these words in the Senate, Hanc culpam maiorem

since I know Greek, and yet say bini in talking to you ;
and you are just putting it on here, as though I spoke
in Greek, and notin Latin. Ruta and menta 5—we use
both words without impropriety. Ι want to use the
diminutive of menta, as one might say rutula 3 it is not
done. Bella tectoriola θ ; then use the diminutive of
pavimenta in that way 3 you can’t do it. Do you see

Ι then that all this is nothing but silly nonsense 3 that

there is indecency neither in the word nor in the
thing, so that there is none anywhere ?
Therefore we introduce obscenities into words of 4
