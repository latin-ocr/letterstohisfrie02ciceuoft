CICERO ΤΟ PLANCUS

Rome, end of June, 43 mc.

All our hopes rest on you and your colleague, ⁰ the l
gods helping us. The cordial agreement between
you clearly expressed to the Senate in your joint
doepatch gave extraordinary pleasure both to the
Senate and the entire State.

You wrote to 1118 about the land commission ⁶· ,2
well, had the Senate been consulted, I should have
supported whoever proposed the most complimentary
motion about you, and that man would certainly
have been myself. But so tardy was the expression
of opinions and so dilatory the transaction of business,
3881113 that the matters under discussion were not
arriving at a settlement, your brother Plancus and
1 decided to accept the decree of the Senate which
ζὲῗεέῗιῗέ ’11ῗῇᾎέἓῖζὲἓὲἓὲ 12³¹st {QZ}
in exact agreement with our wishes.

But if there is an ything that disappoints you in 3
the decree of the Senate, or in an ything else, rect
assured of this, that such 13 the affection all patriots
feel for you in their hearts, that it is impossible to
imagine any kind of position, however exalted, which
is not yours for -the asking. 1 await your letter
with much eagerness, and such a letter too as 1

above all things doeire.
θ 1t was probably Seu-vilius, for whom see note on x. 1⁶2. 8.
