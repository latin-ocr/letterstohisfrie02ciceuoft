1 ¹ fashion, those involving a man's civil status or his
⁸ reputation, of course, in a more ornate style ; but my
‚ letters Ι generally compose in the language of every-
¹ > ὼῇιξῗῖῃγίιοπ, my dear Paetus, how did it ever 2
suggest itself to you to say that there had never

. ⁷ been a single Papirius who was not a plebeian?
, Why, there have been patricians of the lesser

- clans,⁰ the first of whom was L. Papirius Mugillanus,
who was censor with L. Sempronius Atratinus,

1 having previously δ been the same man's colleague
ί ἶ as consul, 312 years after the foundation of the City.

γ But you were then called Papisii.⁶
, After him there were thirteen who occupied the
’ curule chair before L. Papirius Crassus, who was the

²* first not to be called Papisius. He was appointed

Δ dictator, with L. Papirius Cursor as his master of
⁸⁵ horse, 415 years aster the foundation of the City,
· and four years afterwards consul with C. Duilius.

He was followed by Cursor,⁶ a man who held very

many offices of state3 there followed L. Masso,

ᾗ them; for with the exception of that G. Carbo‚⁶ who

J was slain by Damasippus, not one· of them was a true
and loyal citizen. We all knew Cn. Carbo, and his
brother the joeter3 was there ever a more rascally

η ⁰ Slain in 82. having been tribune of the plebs in 90, and
one of the authors of the Lex Plautia Papiria, which gave
the Italians the citizenship of Rome.
