EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. v.

And yet, if I am not mistaken, the present position 2
is such that the ultimate issue of the whole war de-
pends apparently upon D. Brutus ; if once he suc-
ceeds, as we hope he will, in breaking out of Mutina,
it looks as if there would be nothing left of the war.
In any case the ..forces investing him must by this
time be vinconsiderable, because the garrison with
which Antony holds Bononia is a strong one. Again

ς our stiend Hirtius is at Claterna? and Caesar at

Forum Cornelium,⁶ each of them with an army that
can be trusted, while, at Rome, Pansa has collected
strong forces by means of an Italian levy. So far
winter has made active operations impossible.
Hirtius, 'as he frequently hints to me in his letters,
seems unlikely to do anything without careful con-

} ’ sideration. ⁴ With the exception of Bononia, Regium·

Lepidi‚⁰ and Parma, we can count upon the whole of
Gaul as being enthusiastically loyal to the Republic.
Your clients beyond the Padus too we find sur-
prisingly in sympathy with our cause. The Senate
is thoroughly staunch‚ except, of course, the consulam,

ἱ of whom L. Caesar alone is as staunch as he is

sti-ai ht.

’ΝΞ have lost a powerful safeguard by the death of 3
Servius Sulpicius.·² All the others lack either spirit
or sound principle3 not a few of them are jealous of
the honour paid to those whom they see winning the
approval of the state. On the other hand the
unanimity of the people of Rome and of all Italy is
something wonderful. This is practically all that I
think you ought to know. And now my prayer is that
the sunlight of your valour may shine forth from
wherever you are in the East.
