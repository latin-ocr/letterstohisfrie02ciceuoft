EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X. 1v.

roetrain me, and if I were in doubt, your exhortation
enough to impel me to follow whatever course you
deemed to be the best. As it is, however, what is
there that could possibly draw me in any different
direction ? Whatever advantages Ι possess whether
bestowed upon me by the bounty of fortune or won
by my own exertions, although you, in your love
for me, attach too high a value to them, are yet, even
in the opinion of my bitterest enemy, so consider-
able, as to appear to lack nothing but an honourable
reputation.⁰
Be assured then of this one fact, that whatever 3
my powers can accomplish, my prudence foresee,
or my persona] influence prescribe, all that will ever
be at the disposal of the Republic. I am well aware
of your political attitude ; and had Ι the opportunity
(and indeed Ι long for it) of being actually with
you‚I should never disagree with your policy3 and even
as it is, 1 shall not be so ill-advised as to put it in
your power to censure any act of mine with justice.
I am eagerly awaiting news on all matters, so as 4

to know what is done in Hither Gaul, and what in
the City, in the mouth of J anuary. Meanwhile
what causes me the greatest solicitude and anxiet-y
is the fear that, tempted on 311 sides by the weak-
nesses of their enemy, these Gallie tribes may look
upon our difficulties as their opportunity. But if my
success is in proportion to my deserts, I shall at any
rate satisfy not only yourself, whom it is my chief

¹ desire to satisfy, but also all men who are patriota.

Be sure to keep well, and love me as Ι love you.

⁰ He probably refers to what Cicero says of him in x. 3. 8,
⁷ ‘⁸ that he was thought too much of a time-server.'’
