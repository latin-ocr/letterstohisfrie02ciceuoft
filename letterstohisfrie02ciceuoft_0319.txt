EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X.
D. Brutus, finally caused his soldiers to demand the consul-

i ship for him. Τὴε Senate appealed desperately to their

officers commanding in the East and in Africa. Cicero's

ζ’ last letter preserved to us (xii. 10) is a request to C. Cassius
to come to Italy, and the last extant addressed to Cicero is
'⁴ one from Plancus, dated July 28th (x. 23), in which he

:⁷ &ks of his reluctance to risk a battle and complains of
' vius's ambitious projecls. Octavius with his eight
ἦ legions and Julius Caesar’s African veterans, who went over
to him, overpowered the resistance of the Senate and was
ι elected consul for 42 mc. in his twentieth year. Pollio im-
2⁷ mediately went over to Antony and Lepidus ; Plancus stood
J out a little lo r, until Pollio arranged a reconciliation
’ between him an Antony. D. Brutus endeavoured to force

¹' his way to M. Brutus in the East, but was slain at Aquileia,

 

at Antony’s bidding, probably in October.
