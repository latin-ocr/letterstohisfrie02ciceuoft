CICERO

cabo malitiam meam. Volebam 'prope alieubi esse
te, si quid bonae salutis, σύν τε δυ ἐρχομένω. Nune,
cum confecta sunt omnia, dubitandum non est, quin
equis viris. Nam, ut audivi de L. Caesare F„ mecum
ipse : quid hic mihi saciet patri ? Itaque non desino ν
apud istos, qui nunc dominantur, cenitare. Quid
2 faciam ? tempori serviendum est. Sed ridicula
missa, praesertim cum sit nihil, quod rideamus.

Africa terribili tremit horrida terra tumultu

Itaque nullum est ἀποπροηγμένον, quod non verear.
Sed quod quaeris, quando, qua, quo, nihil adhuc sci·
mus. Istuc ipsum de Baiis, nonnulli dubitant, an per
Sardiniam veniat. Illud enim adhuc praedium suum
non inspexit ι nec ullum habet deterius, sed ta'men

⁶ Hom. Il. x. 224 σύν τε δύ’ ἐρχομένω καί τε πρὸ ὃ τοῦ ἐνόησεν,
“ when two men meet, one gets an idea before the other.”

θ L. Caesar (called filius to distinguish him from his
father, L. Caesar, consul in 64 n-c.) joined Pompey at the
beginning of the Civil War in 49 B.c.‚ and was the bearer oi

messages backwards and forwards between Pompey and Ι

Caesar. In 46 he was proquaestor to Cato at Utica, bui
after Cato’s death persuaded the citizens to sul-render to
Caesar. He was pardoned by Caesar, but afterwards,
possiibly,d though not probably, at Caesar's instigation¹
mur ere .

⁶ Ter. Andr. 112, where Simo asks, ‘⁸ if my son Pamphilus
weeps thus at the funeral of Chrysis, a comparative stt-anger,
what will he when 1, his father, die? ” Cicero here appar-
ently applies the quotation to the pardoniny of L. Caesar
by Julius Caesar, and means “ if Caesar treats a former foe
so well, how will he treat an old friend like me ἲ ” Tyr-rell,
howeventakes the words as refer-rin to L. Caesar's supposed
‘murder by Caesar, and thinks that {icero means ‘⁸ If Caesar
puts to death an obscure opponent like L. Caesar, what will
he do to me, a much more marked enemy Ρ ” This erhaps
suits the context better, but it makes Cicero assume ᾅδει-ἐ
guilt, though it was never proved.
