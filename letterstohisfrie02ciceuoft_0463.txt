EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XI. 11.

done so not only by edict ‘¹ but by letter as well, we
surely doeerve that you should admit us into your
connsels, especially in a matter which affects ourselvoe.

ἰ interests⁶ in the month of June is as frivolous as it is
² futile. Whom do you suppose to be likely to obstruet
