It is true that they ⁰ are surveying the lands about 2
Veii and Capena? and that is not very far from my
Tusculan estate. Still Ι feel no alarm ; Ι enjoy my
ῗὲῗῖἷυῗὲεἶῗέ ῖῖιιῗτΐὲὲέἒῖ {1335 ἶζεὶῗῖἷῃῖἒ Ψᾶζᾞέά
philosopher in one as I am Ξ) have come to the con-
clusion that of all things the most beautiful is life,
cannot but regard with affection the man by whose
grace Ι have been granted it. And if it be his desire
that there should be a commonwealth, such as
possibly both he wishes and we all ought to pray
for, none the less he does not know what to do,
so inextricably has he tied himself up with his
multitude of counsellors

But I am running on too far3 for it is to you⁶3
that Ι am writing. Of this much, however, you may
rest assured, that not only do Ι, who take no part in
their oounsels, not lmow, but even the chief himself
dooe not know what is going to happen. While we
are his slaves, he is himself the slave of circumstances.
It follows that neither can he possibly know what the
circumstances will demand of him, nor we, what he
has in his mind.

If Ι did not send you this reply before, it is not that
Ι am often a laggard, especially in correspondence, but
not having anything certain to go upon, it was no
¹wish of mine either to cause you anxiety by my in-
decision, or give you grounds for hope by any positive
assertion. This much, however, 1 must add, and it is
the absolute truth, that as matters stand up to the
present, I have heard nothing of the danger you
mention! Be that as it may, it will be your duty,
with characteristic wisdom, to hope for the beet, to
contemplate the worst‚ and to bear whatever happens.
