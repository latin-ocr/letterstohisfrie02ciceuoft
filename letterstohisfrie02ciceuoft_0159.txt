VIII

CAELIUS To CICERO
Rome, October, 51 13.c.⁰

Though Ι have plenty to tell you about politics, yet 1
Ι have nothing which will give you greater pleasure,
Ι imagine, than this. You must know that C. Sem-
pronius Rufus ⁶—Rufus, Ι say, the apple of your
eye—has won, amid universal applause, nothing less
than a conviction for malicious prosecution. ‘⁸ What
was the case ? '’ you will ask„ Well, when the Roman
games ⁶ were over, he brought a charge of violence
under the Plotian law against his own accuser, M.
Tuccius 5²3 and his object was this—he saw that if no
defendant was brought into court whose case could
claim precedence‚⁶' he would have to stand his own
trial this year ; and what the result of that would be,
he could, of course, have no doubt. And he thought
there was nobody upon whom he 'could more fittingly
boetow this little attention than his own prosecutor.
So, without getting anybody to back t ‘his charge,
down he came into the forum, and brought an accusa-
tion against Tuccius, =As soon as I got wind of it,
without waiting to be asked, 1 hurried up and took
my seat on the defendant's bench. I rise‚ and with-
out a word about the question at issue, I vigorously
impugn Sempronius and all his works, to the extent of
even dragging in Vestorius, and telling the old story
of how, if there was anything held by Vestorius,
‘⁶ which he, Sempronius, wrongfully possessed,'’ he,

f Subscriptores were the subordinate advocates foi· the
prosecution, who attached their names to the charge.
