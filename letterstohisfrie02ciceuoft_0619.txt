EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. xix—xx.

1 therefore pray that no movement will be made by
that nation at the present time—I mean until those
legions reach you, which Ι am told are being marched
up. But if you possess no forces to match the enemy
in the field, I am sure γοα will not forget to pursue
the policy of M. Bibulus‚⁰ who confined himself to a
stro ly fortified and well provisioned town during
the affiole time the Parthians were in the province.

But all this γοα will arrange better for yourself, 3
according to time and circumstances. I shall myself
never cease to be anxious as to what you are doing, =
' until Ι know what you have done. On no occasion,
when I have found anybody by whom Ι could send
you a letter, have I omitted to do SO. Ι beg of you
to do the same, and most particularly to write to
your friends in such a way as to convince them that I
too am your friend.

CICERO TO 'nn-2 SAME
Rome, early in 46 (ἲ) mc.

Your letter pleased me, except that γοα expressed
contempt for my little lodgings at Sinuessa,¹’—an
insult which will be bitterly resented by my tiny little
villa, unless you make the amende honor-able at my
Cuman or Pompeian house. You will therefore do
so, and show your love for me, and stir me up by
writing something ; for Ι can more easily reply to a
challenge than offer one. But if you are lazy—and
that's what you are—I shall do the stirring up, and
your lethargy will not infect me too with indolence.
More when I have leisure. 1 am in the Senate as I
jot this down.
