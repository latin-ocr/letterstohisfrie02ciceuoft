Plancus at this time was evidentl chagrined at the slow ,ς

some difficulty in soothing him (x. 12).

After the‘engagement near Forum Gallorum, Hirtius and ι’

Octavius had collected all their available forces against
Antony, and after some days, towards the end of April,
Hirtius succeeded in drawing Antony from his enti-ench-
ments, and forcing upon him a general action, in which

Antony was completely defeated, and compelled to raise ⁴

the war against Antony.

Cicero still urged D. Brutus and Plancus to co—operate‚
and their union took place early in June. Their combined
forces outnumbered those of Antony and Lepidus, but they
shrank from taking the offensive.
