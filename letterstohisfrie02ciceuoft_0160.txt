⁰ It would seem that Cicero had enabled Sempronius to
borrow money from Vestorius, another banker of Puteoli;
butas Sempronius repudiated the debt, Vestorius kept in his
hands an equivalent amount of Sempronius’s property—an

ὓ This com licated case may be summarized as follows.
C. Claudius ulcher, brother of Appius and Clodius, was
proconsul of Asia in 55-54 n.c., and in 51 1³.c. was tried
for repetunda& “ extortion,” and condemned. Damages

Laterensis held that there was no case, owing to lack of
evidence. Upon this Q. Pilius direetly charged Servilius
with repetundae. This brought up Appius, son of C.
