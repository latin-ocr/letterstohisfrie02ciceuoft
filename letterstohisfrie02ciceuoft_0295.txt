Α nothing. He had three brothers, Gaius, Gnaeus,

= = and Marcus Carbo.

Marcus, a big thies, on the accusation of P. Flaccus,
was condemned for his misdeeds in Sicily3 Gaius,

φ , on being accused by L. Crassus, is said to have taken
Α a dose of cantharides ‘¹ ; he was not only a turbulent
,γ tribune of the plebs, but was suspected of having
assassinated P. Africanus? But as for this Carbo,

’ who' was put to death by our friend Pompey in Lily-

· haeum, there was never, in my opinion, a greater

sooundrel. It was his father again who, on being

³ Α aoeused by M. Antonius, is supposed to have evaded
condemnation by means of shoemaker’s vitriol.⁶ So
1 think you had better go back to your patrician
sorbeam ; as for the plebeians, you see what &trouble-
ι, ,ζ some crew they were.

CICERO ΤΟ 'rm-2 snm
Rome, July, 45 mc.

-f 1 like modesty, others prefer freedom, in speech. 1

And indeed the latter opinion was held by Zeno,·¹
a man, Ῑ assure you, of penetration, although our
ε Academy quarrels fiercely with him. But, as 1 say,
³: the Stoioe hold that we should call everything by its

proper name. This is their argument—nothing is
¹ obscene, nothing shameful in the saying of it ; for if

therebe anything scandalous in obscenity,it is eitherin
nnexoeptional dramatic passagen and if not in the thing,

⁷ asertiori it cannot be in the word (ἐξ 2-4); therefore there

is no such thing as impurity anywhere, and ‘the wisc man
will call a spade a spade? ’⁹ Tyr-rell. Cicero also ridiculoe
the prurient detection of obscenity where there is none.
