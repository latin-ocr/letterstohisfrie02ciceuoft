CICERO

nunc autem quid est, sine his cur vivere velimus?
Mihi vero cum his ipsis vix, his autem detractis ne vix·

et emptionem feliciter evenire volo, tuumque in ea
re consilium probo. Cura, ut valeas.

Terentia minus belle habuit, sed certum seio iam
convaluisse eam. Praeterea rectissime sunt apud te
omnia. Etsi nullo tempore in suspicionem tibi debui
venire, partium causa potius, quam tua, tibi suadere,
ut te aut cum Caesare nobiscumque coniungeres, aut
certe in otium referres, praecipue nunc, iam inclinata
victoria, ne possum quidem in ullam aliam incidere
opinionem, nisi in eam, in qua scilicet tibi suadere

ὃ Publius Cornelius Dolabella, who married Cicero’s
daughter Tullia after divorcing his wife Fabia in 51 8.c.,
was one of the most unprincipled men of his age, and a
constant cause of anxiety to Cicero, who however rofessae
a great affection for him. He fou ht for Caesar at harsana
(48), in Africa (46), and in Spain 45), and was made consul
by him in 44. After Caesar's assassination he went over to
the Republican party, but soon deserted that party when
Antony gave him the province of Syria. On his way to his
prffiffc} he plundergd ἓΙὲθΊςὶῒίξε of Gigleee aorzd Asilaoilssfflgg,

Being decl{red a public enemy in 43 hepwas besieged by
Cassius at Laodicea, where, to avoid falling into his enemies’
hands, he ordered one of his own men to kill him. It is
highly probable that Dolabella wrote this letter at the in-
stance of Caesar, who desired Cicero’s friendship.
