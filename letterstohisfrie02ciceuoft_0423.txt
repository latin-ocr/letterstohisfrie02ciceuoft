menno ‘ro umus munius ⁸
Rome, J uly eth, 43 n-c.

Of my keen interest in your restoration and rein-
statement you have, Ι believe, been informed in the

’ letters of your friends, whom 1 am well assured that
Ι have most abundantly satisfied3 and, singularly
· devoted to you as they are, I do not yield to them
so far as to admit that they desire your restoration
, more than 1 do myself. It is they who must needs
· yield precedence to me, considering that at the
present moment 1 can serve you more effectually
' than they; and to serve you I have never ceased‚
'3 nor ever shall cease ; indeed, I have already done so
J in a matter of paramount importance, and have laid
the foundations of your restoration. See to it that

' you keep up your spirits and courage, and be assured
γ of my unfailing support in every respect. J uly 6th.

GALBA ἃ 'ro CICERO
camp at Mutina, April 15th‚ 43 mc.

On April 14th, the day on which Hirtius was to 1
have been joined in camp by Pansa, with whom
I was (for I had advanced 100 miles to meet him, in
order to hasten his arrival), on that day Antony
ι brought out two legions, the second and the thirty-

, fifth, and two praetorian cohorts, one his own, the
f perot Galba, served under Caesar in Gaul, and was praetor
ὲ in 54. He was now serving against Antony at Mutina.
