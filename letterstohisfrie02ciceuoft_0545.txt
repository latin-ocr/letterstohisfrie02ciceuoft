ξ EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XI. xxxx.

{- friends to you and rendering you every possible
g, service, Ι shall deem myself devoid of humanity.
⁴ You, my dear Oppius, will, I know, maintain your 3
⁷ affection for me (though 1 write thus more from force
of habit than because I think you need reminding)‚
and keep an eye on my interests in all raepeess, and
if you do -not know what they are, Ι have instructed
ζ Atticustotell you. In any ease, as soon as I find a
ἕ moment’s leisure‚ you may expect a fuller letter from
f myself. Do your boet to keep well; nothing you
ἒ ean do will give me greater pleasure than that.
