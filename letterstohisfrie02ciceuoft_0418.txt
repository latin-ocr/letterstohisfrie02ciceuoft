l Quam vellem ad illas pulcherrimas epulas me
Idibus Martiis invitasses! reliquiarum nihil habe-
remus. At nunc cum his -tantum negoti est, ut
vestrum illud divinum in rempublicam beneficium
nonnullam habeat querellam. Quod vero a te, viro
optimo, seductus est, tuoque beneficio adhuc vivit
haec pestis, interdum, quod mihi vix fas est, tibi
subirascor. Mihi enim negoti plus reliquisti uni,

α C. Trebonius began his public life as a supporter of the
aristocratic part , and, as quaoetor in 60 n.c., opposed the
adoption of P. lodius into a plebeian family. oon after-

Pompey should have the two S ains, Crassus Syria, and
Caesar the Gauls and Illyricum, or a further period of five

Ιζηοννη as the Lex Trebonia. In 48, as praetor urbanus, he
resisted the wild schemes of his colleague‚ M. Caelius Rufus.
Caesar made him consul in October, 45, and romised him the

rovince of Asia. In spite of all this rebonius took a. η

eading part in the conspiracy to assassinate Caesar, and
shortly after the murder proceeded to his province of Asia.
He never received this lether, as he was murdered by Dolabella

&Saeyana before the end of J anuary. (J oseph. xiv. 223. 225.)
