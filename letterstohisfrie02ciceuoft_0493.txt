had already joined him, a public speech of his was
reported to me, in which he began to entreat his
men to follow him across the Alps, adding that he had

Ventidius (for Antony has very few indeed of his own),
to the effect that they were bound either to die or to
conquer in Italy 3 and they began to implore him to

them, he put off his march until the following day.

Senate and magistratoe from Cularo, about June 11. This
view is corroborated by the consistent use of the plural—noe.
nobis, noetro. The words omitted before “ in spem venerant ’⁹
were undoubtedly ‘⁶ Antonius et Lepidus.”
