EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. xm -xrv.

upon Lepta, whom Ι oeteem more highly than
an bod

ἶ do got, it 18 true, consider what Ι am about to say 4
particularly relevant to the matter, but still there
is no harm' m saying it—the property of one of them
is exceedingly limited, that of the other hardly what
a knight should have.⁰ And therefore, seeing that
Caoear with characteristic generosity has granted
thoee men their lives, and they have nothing much
besides of which they can be deprived, well then,
if you love me as much as I am sure you do, clinch
the business of these poor fellows’ return, the only
obstacle to which is the length of the journey ; and
that they do not shrink from, so that they may
both live with their own folks and die at home.
, To struggle and strive to this end, or rather to

carry the matter through (for of your ability to do so
I have no manner of doubt)—that is what I earnestly
beg of you again and again to do.

CICERO TO THE SAME
Pompeii, May 3, 44 n-c.

Though I am well content, my dear Dolabella, with 1
the glory ⁶ you have won, and though the happiness
and pleasure 1 have derived from it is amply sufficient,
still 1 cannot but admit that my greatest and crowning
joy is that popular opinion writes me down a partner
in your praises.1 have met nobody (and I meet ever
f so many people every day, for numbers of our most
f the mob, and punished the worshippers. This is the action
ξ of Dolabella so peffusively praised by Cicero m this letter.
