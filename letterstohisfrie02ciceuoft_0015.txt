CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY

¹ intended to check the growing power of Pompey.
, Caesar is elected Pontifex Maximus. Cicero carries
ξ in the Senate the proposal of a supplicatio of
'‘ unusual length to Pompey in honour of his eastern

trium hs.

§2.pHaving conciliated his colleague C. Antonius
by resigning to him the govemorship in 62 of the
rich province of Macedonia, Cicero felt himself
able in the autumn of 63 to oppose the treasonable
doeigns of L. Sergius Catilina, of which he had full
information from the spy, L. Curius. In the consular
elections for 62 Catiline was again defeated. On
October 21 Cicero foretold the rising of the Catili-
narian Manlius in Etruria on the 27th. Martial law
was proclaimed‚ and the conspirators failed in an
attempt to seize Praeneste on November 1, and
another plot to murder Cicero was exposed. But
Catiline had the audacity to appear in the Senate on
November 8, when Cicero so crushingly denounced
him that he left Rome to take command of the
insurgents in Etruria.

5 3. Certain envoys of the Allobroges, having been
approached by the conspirators to supply Catiline
with cavalry, were arrested, and on the strength of
incriminating letters found upon them the following
five conspirators were seized and imprisoned— P.
Lentulus Sura (praetor), C. Cethegus (senator), L.
Statilius, P. Gabinius Cimber, and M. Caeparius;
and at a meeting of the Senate on December 5,
mainly at the instance of M. Cato, though Caesar,
then praetor elect, was opposed to it, a decree was
carried that the five conspirators arrested should be
put to death, and that same evening they were
strangled under Cicero’s supervision.
