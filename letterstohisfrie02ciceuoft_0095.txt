EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VII. xxi- xxu.

in your view we might* safely make that stipulation ‘⁸

. ‘⁸ If the Praetor, Q. Caepio, in accordance with his

² edict, has granted me the possession of Turpilia’s
estate, etc.,’' he said that Servius maintained that a
will, made by one who had not the legal right to

. make a will, was no will at all, and that Ofilius

concurred. Silius said he had not talked it over
with you, and asked me to commend him and his
case to you. There is no better man, my dear Testa,

⁸, and 1 have no better friend than P. Silius, with the

 

.ss exception indeed of yourself. You will therefore
’ἰ greatly oblige me by going to him without an

1 invitation and promising to do what he wants. But,
’ as you love me, do so as soon as possible. This Ι

earnzttly beg of you to do, and Ι reiterate my
requ .

You made fun of me yesterday over our wine for
saying it was a disputed point whether an heir could
lawfuny prosecute on a charge of thefl: committed
before he succeeded to the property. So, although
1 had returned home comfortably mellow and at
a late honr, I nevertheless marked the section in
which this question is discussed, and I have sent you
a correct copy of it, so as to convince you that the
opinion held, according to you, by no one, was held
by Sextus Aelius, Manius Manilius, and Marcus
Brutus3 all the same, 1 agree with Scaevola and
Testa.
