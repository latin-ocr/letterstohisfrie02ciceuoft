EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VIII. x.

that you either puffed out somebody’s sails for him‚⁰ or
held back something which it was important to know.
lt is now the close of the year3 for 1 am writing 3
Δ this letter on the 17th of November. Ι clearly see
” that nothing can be done before January lst. You
ἰ know Marcellus‚¹’—how slow and inefficient he is, and
also how dilatory Servius is!> What manner of men do
