EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XI. x1x.—xx.

which you all supported, I did not think it necessary
to trouble myself so much about anything else. As
it is, however, seeing that 1 am lest with only the
neediest of recruits, I have every reason to fear on
my account as well as yours.

The Vicetini‘* are showing special deference to 2
M. Brutus and myself. I beg you not to allow these
people to have any injustice done them in the Senate
in the matter of the native slaves ,ὓ They have a very
strong case, they are sincerely devoted to the Re-
public, and their opponents are a disorderly and
thoroughly indolent class of men. Vercellae, May

you and your kind servicoe to me compel me to do on
yours,—and that is to fear. Though 1 had often been
told the story, and had thought seriously of it, only
the other day Labeo Segulius (and it is just like him)

to the remark which he said you had made ‘⁶ that
. the young man should be praised, honoured, and

ζ · allowing himself to be made immortal. For my

· part, I believe that it was Labeo who reported the

, Tyrrell's “exalted to the skiae”; for, to a Roman, heaven
was not up above, but down below.
