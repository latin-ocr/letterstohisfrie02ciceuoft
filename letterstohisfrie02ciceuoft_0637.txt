Rome, early in May, 43 ια’

You commend to me my friend P. Lucceius? and 6
in whatever way Ι can, I shall keep a careful eye
upon him. It is true that we have lost Hirtius and
Pansa, colleagues of ours, and men who did good
sound work for the Republic during their consulship,
at a most inauspicious time, when the Republic,
though delivered from the freebooting of Antony,
had not entirely extricated herself. That Republic,
if I am so privileged, Ι shall defend after my fashion,
although Inow feel utterly tired out ; but no amount

3 of fatigue should hinder a man from doing his duty

and keeping his word.

But no more of this for the present. Ι prefer that Ἰ
your information about me should come from others
rather than from myself. The news I hear of you is
all that I could desire. The rumours about Cn.
Minucius‚⁶ the man you lauded up to the skies in
some of your letters, are less favourable. I should
be glad if you would inform me as to the true nature
of that business, and generally, as to what is being
done in your part of the world.
