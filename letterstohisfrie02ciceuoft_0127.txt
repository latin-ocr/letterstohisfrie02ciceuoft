 

EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VII. xxxm.

ever produce something worthy of my reputation,
Ι heave a sigh at the thought that, as Philoctetes
says in Accius,

These arrows shoot 1 now at feathered folk,

Not fooe in arms: there is no glory in it.⁰

However, if you come, it will make life generally
more cheerful for me, though your coming, as you are
yourself aware, will coincide m‘th what I may call a
massed attack of the most pressing business engage-
ments ; and if Ι can but meet them as I would, well,
then Ι shall bid a long farewell to both forum and
senate—house, and spend much of my time with you
and those who love us both. For your friend
Cassius and my friend Dolabella (or Ι should rather
call them both my friends), are absorbed in the
same studies, and find in me a very kindly critic.

Here we need the help of your exquisitely refined
discrimination and of that esoteric eruditiori of yours,
whereby you often make me rather ashamed of
myself when 1 am speaking. Indeed Ι have made
up my mind, if only Caesar will either permit or
press me to do so, at last to drop that role⁶ in which
Ι have so osten approved myself even to him, conceal
myself completely in literature, and in company with
you and all other literary enthusiasts‚ enjoy the
sweets of a most honourable retirement.

As for yourself‚ Ι could have wished you had not
expressed any sear of my being ever inclined to
yawn over any letter of yours, should you by any
chance have sent me, as you put it, rather a long
one ; and Ι would have you henceforth regard it as

settled that the longest letters you send me give
me the greatest pleasure.
