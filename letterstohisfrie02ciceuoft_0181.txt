EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VIII. x.

and how far the necessity for it would be taken as a
j- sufficient justification, as to that I have my misgivings

horde of Arabs into his province, and reported these
to the Senate as being Parthians.

And that is why Ι urge you, whatever be the position
of affairs in your province, to be careful and cautious
in your drafted report of it, lest it be said of you
