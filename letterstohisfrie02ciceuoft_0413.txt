EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X. xxm—xxva

not wish you to be uninformed as to my own opinion,
the main purport of which is this t I would have you
appraise your general outlook by the standard of
true desert, rather than by the prospect of high
office, and seek a fuller fruition of your hopoe in an
abiding renown, than in the rapid attainment of a
praetorship. These are the very words I spoke at
aa *vs-02? wziffiaeffizzdssssffzzzffibazzhss Qua
to you?whaelh Dardanus’ too, your freeded: was one
of the party. My words seemed to meet with unani-
mous approval. But you wil] be the baet judge. ’

Rome, end of June, 43 mc.

On reading the letter in which you made it plain 1
that you must either sacrifice the Narbonenses⁰ or
fight a hazardous battle, I was more afraid of the ,
former course, and am not sorry it has been avoided.
You write about the cordial relations between
Plancus and Brutus ; well, it is that fact that makes
me most sanguine of victory. As to the enthusiasm
of the Gauls, we shall some day discover, as you
write, who it was that succeeded in exciting it ;
though, as a matter of fact, we have discovered it
already! So naturally, immensely pleased as I was
with your letter, the end of it exasperated me ; you
write that, if the elections are put off till August, you

regrets his intention to return to Rome instead of carrying
ἢ on his good work abroad.
