consuls .· C. Vibius Pansa ana A. Hirtius

After a series of events too complicated even to
summarize here? C. Octavius, by then called Octavi-
anus, formed a triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus,
who removed their chief opponents by proscriptio.
Among the proscribed was Cicero.

After wandering for some days along the Latin
coast, distracted and depressed by the murder at
Rome of his brother and nephew, on December ’7
he was overtaken in his litter near Formiae by
Antony’s offieer Herennius. Offering no resistance,
he was killed, and his head and hands were taken
to Rome, where they were exposed by order of
Antony on the Rostra.

Thus died Cicero, in the sixty—fourth year of
his a e.

Polgitically as vacillating as he was personally vain,
and sadly lacking in that very prudentia on which
he so pathetically prided himself, Cicero was yet

splendidly consistent as a patriot and a champion Α

of libert .

The gl‘reatest of Rome’s orators and a distinguished
philosopher, he stands before us in his letters ἃς, in
the best and fullest sense of the word, a human-
hearted man: and it is his letters that will be his
most enduring monument.
