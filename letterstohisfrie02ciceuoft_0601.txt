EPISTULAE AD¹FAM1L1AREs‚ XII. xv.

Thrilled with apprehension of such a disaster, Con· 3
script Fathers, Ι deemed it best to brook any inj urious
goeture, even if it meant my being insulted, and to
try every expedient sooner than take action. Ac-
cordingly, being brought into their city and into their
senate by their own wish, I pleaded the cause of the
Republic with all the earnestness in my power, and
set before them the whole extent of the danger
which would threaten them, if once that brigand
should have embarked with all his confederates. I
found the Rhodians, however, so utterly wrongheaded
as to attribute greater strength to any party than to
the loyalists3 to give no ready credence to the creation '
of this spirit of harmony and unanimity among all
orders in the defence of freedom3 to feel confident
that the forbearance of the Senate and the whole
patriotic party was as imperturbable as ever and
that no one would have dated judge Dolabella as an
enemy⁰; to conclude, in short, that the truth lay
rather in the misrepresentations of unprincipled men
than in what had actually occurred and what I was
telling them.

They were under this delusion when, even before 4

an a o er a omma e crimes, o em assies
had been despatched by them to Dolabella—surely
a breach of precedent and in contravention of their
own laws ὃ and of the prohibition of those at the time
in office ; they were under this delusion again, when
(whether from sear, as they repeatedly alleged, of
losing the lands they hold on the mainland, or in a fit
of madness, or owing to the undue ascendancy of
those few who had previously treated with contumely
our most distinguished citizens, and were now treat-

but being overborne by some violent democrats among their

number. Tyrrell.
