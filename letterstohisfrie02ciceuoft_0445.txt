EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X. xxxin.

he wrote me such letters as Ῑ send for your perusal,
manifaetly in much the same tone as the public
speechoe he is said to have made at Narbo, it was
obviously essential that Ι should smooth him down, if
Ι wanted to get my supplies when marching through
his province. Moreover, Ι was afraid that, if the

all because of my friendship with Antony, which after
all was no greater than that with Plancus.

In the month of April then I embarked two letter· 3
carriers on two separate ships, and wrote from Gades
’ to yourself and the consuls and Octavian, asking you
to inform me by what manner of means 1 could best
. serve the Republic. But, according to my reckoning,
Δ the ships started from Gadoe on the very day Pansa
⁴ fought his battle. For, since the winter, no sailing
τ was possible before that date. And Ι solemnly aver
that I had put my legions into winter quarters in the

heart of Lusitania before Ι had the remotest sus-

come to blows as if what they feared more than any-
thing was the settlement of the war without the
³ maximum of damage to the Republic. But if there
. was any need for haste, in my view every single

¹ success achieved by Hirtius was marked by the
ἰ V strategy of a consummate commander.

 

Just now the written and oral reports I receive 4
