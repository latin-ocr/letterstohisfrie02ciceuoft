is where, according to his own letter, he has arranged
to await me. But if only Lepidus himself, and
fortune, keep me a perfectly free field, Ῑ give you
my assurance that 1 shall speedily settle the business
to your satisfaction.

1 informed you in a previous letter that my 2
brother, exhausted by his incessant exertions and
constantly hurrying from place to place, was seriously
ill; but in spite of that, as soon as ever he could
ἡ put foot to ground, reflecting that his recovery was

&dgreiater-berhegt to himstellf {223 tol the State, he

no slmnk m takmg e w en an danger
was to be met. However I not only urged5i1im‚ but
even compelled him to start for Rome, because (as
Ῑ argued) in his state of health he could more easily
wear himself out, than be of any assistance to me
in camp, and also because 1 really thought that
the Republic,1est desolate by the tragie fall of her
consuls, stood in need of such a citizen to act as
praetor in the busin& of the city. And if any
man among you disapprovae of my action, let me
assure him that it was Ι who lacked prudence in so
advising‚ and not he who lacked loyalty to his country.

Anyhow Lepidus—and that is just what 1 wanted 3
-arranged to send me Apella, for me to use him as
