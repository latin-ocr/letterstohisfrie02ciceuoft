. Certainly, Ι think the 5th of June will be high time ⁵ l
on account not only of the eonstitutional crisis but
of the season of the year. Ι therefore approve your
choiee of date, and shall accordingly keep to the
same myself. ⁷

As to the course we adopted‚⁶ I should not have 2
thought that me ought to regret it, even if those
who did not adopt it had now no reason to regret
· their decision.⁴² For we followed the lead, not of hope,
but of a sense of duty ; on the other hand, what we
turned our backs on was not duty, but a hopeless
cause. We, therefore, had a quicker sense of honour
than those who never stirred from home, and were
las infatuated than those who never returned home

; when all their raeourcoe were exhausted. But there

’ is nothing Ι resent so much as the harsh criticism
of those who did nothing at all 3 and however
the matter stands, I venerate more those who fell
in the war than 1 care for those still with uS, who are
f„ dissatisfied with us for presuming to live.
s* 1f1 have time to come to your Tusculan villa before 3
the 5th, 1 shall see you there; failing that, I shall
follow you to your Cuman villa, and give you notice
beforehand, so that a bath may be ready waiting.
