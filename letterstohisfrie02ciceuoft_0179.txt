EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VIII. 1x.-x.

⁷ Your friend Pompey makes no secret of demur-ring

1 part, being aware of your unpreparedness in the
¹ matter of your army, my special apprehension as

imperil your prestige. For were you better pre-

your life;⁶ as it is, the present numerica] weak-
noes of your forces fills me with foreboding, not
of an engagement, but of a retreat, on your part.
How the public would accept the latter decision,
