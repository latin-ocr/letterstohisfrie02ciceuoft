y EPlsrULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. xx,

ehoked off with your hors-d’oeuvre; no, 1 bring an
= appetite quite unimpaired to bear upon the egg
oourse⁰; and so Ι carry on in grim earnest right up
ιο the roast veal. Those compliments Ι used to wiu
from you in the old dayS, “ What a model of com-
plaisance ἔ What an easy fellow to entertain l ’' are
over and done with. For the present I have thrown
ιο the winds an my political anxieties, all pondering
over speeches for the Senate, all careful preparation
of briefs‚ and Ι have thrown myself into the camp
of my former adversary Epicurus, not, however, with
an eye to this modern extravagance, but to that
luxurious refinement of yours—I mean on the old
scale‚when youhad the money to meet your expenses,
though indeed you have more estates ὃ οη your hands
now than ever. ι
Therefore prepare yourself3 the person you have 2
to deal with is not only a hearty eater, but one who
now knows a thing or two ; and you know how fussy
“ late-learners ’' ⁶ are. You must forget all about
your fruit-pottles and omelettes. I have now
acquired such a store of exquisite skill that Ι quite
frequently venture to invite your friend Verrius&
and Camillus· too, and you know how dainty and
fasfidious they are. But behold my audacity ἔ Ι have
given a dinner even to Hirtius, though there was no
peacock; and at that dinner there was nothing,
except the hot sauce,s that my cook failed to copy.
This then is the way Ι live now ; in the morning I am 3

at home not only to loyalists—a large but melancholy
crowd—but also ιο these exultant conquerorS, and it

⁸ The distin ished lawyer, a great friend of Cicero.
