class, had we not forcibly ejected you. But more
of this anon.

You, who have learnt to take precautionary 2
measures for your clients, must look out in Britain
that you are not cheated by the charioteers and
(since Ι have taken to acting the Medea) always
remember the line-—

Vainlylr wilfi& the fruits of wisdom for himself who cannot

Take ‘care of your health.

CICERO TO THE SAME
Rome, May, 54 mc.

Ι never cease recommending you, but I am anxious l
to know fiom you with what success. My chief hope
is in Balbus, to whom Ι write about you very earnestly
and very frequently. Ι am often surprised at not
receiving letters from you as often as I get them from
my brother Quintus. I hear that in Britain there is
not an ounce of either gold or silver. If that is so, Ι
advise you to capture some war-chariot, and post
back to me as soon as you can.

If, however, setting Britain aside, we can still attain 2
om· object, you must make sure of being one of
Caesar’s intimate friends. In that my brother will
be a great help to you, and so will Balbus 3 but,
believe me, the greatest help of all will be your own
modesty and hard work. ⁸ You have a most generous
imperator, you are at the most suitable age,‘² and
your credentials at any rate are exceptionally good.
So the one thing you have to fear is, that people
may think that you have not done yourself justice.
