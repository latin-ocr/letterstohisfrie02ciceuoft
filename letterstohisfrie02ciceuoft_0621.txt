Rome, in the spring of 44 mc.

My intimate friend C. Anicius}² a most accom-
plished gentleman in every respect, has been allowed
to visit Africa on an unofficial embassy ⁶ in connexion
, with some private negotiations of his own. Ι should
like you to give him every assistance, and do your
beet to enable him to complete his negotiations as
satisfactorily as possible, and more particularly,
because it is a thing most precious in his eyes, do I
commend to you the care of his prestige ; and I beg
of you to do what Ι myself always did in my province
without being asked—I assigned lictors to all senators3
it is an honour I had received myself, and Ι knew it
to be the constant practice of the most distinguished
men to confer it. You will, therefore, Ι am sure, do
so, my dear Cornificius, and in every other respect,
as you love me, promote his prestige and material
interests. I shall be most grateful to you if you do
so. Make a point of keeping well.
