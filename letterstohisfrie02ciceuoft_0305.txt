-’ great weight with me, but also in accordance with

my own inclination and judgment.

¹ For Ι would have you know, my dear Paetus, that
’γ what first began to make me suspicions and wary
⁸ and careful was your letter, and there were other

” subsequent letters from many sources, which tallied

with yours. Both at Aquinum and at Fabrateria

ἶ schemoe were initiated affecting myself which Ι see

you must have overheard; and, just as if they

⁷ guessed what trouble I was going to cause them,
; they made it their one aim and object to crush me.

f And that is why this friend of yours requires no
’ recommendation with me. I only pray that the
’ foi-tumes of the commonwealth may be such as to
enable him to recognize in me the most grateful of
5² men. But no more about this.

I am distroesed at your having given up going 2

- ’ out to dinner. You have deprived yourself of a
'j great deal of amusement and pleasure. In the next
,ζ place I am really afraid (for Ι need not mince matters)
{j that you will unleam and forget to some extent

your old practice of giving little dinners yourself.

ᾖ ξ For if, at the time when you had plenty of hosts to
set you an example, you showed but little improve-
² ment, what am 1 to imagine you will do now ? Spu-
· rinna! indeed, when Ι pointed the thing out to him,
and described your previous life, pointed out that
¹ the whole commonwealth was threatened with a

grave danger unless you reverted to your previous

’ ,ζ habits when Favonius ὗ began to blow; for the
, present, he added, such conduct might be tolerated,

 

ἶ since possibly you could not endure the cold.
