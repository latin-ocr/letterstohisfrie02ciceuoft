EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VII. 1x.-x.

two months. Since you were not with my brother
Quintiis, Ι did not know where, or by whose hand, to
> send a letter. I am anxious to know how you are
getting on, and where you intend spending the
winter. 1 should like you to do so with Caesar, but
I have not ventured to write a word to him because
γ he is in mourning.⁰ I have, however, written to 2
⁷, Balbus. Don’t throw away your chauces,—
⁶ Better retum to us later, so you come with a heavier
purse.
'- There is no reason why you should hurry home,
especially now that Battara θ is dead. But you have
something up your sleeve. I am only anxious to
know what you have decided to do.

Tbere is a certain Cn. Octavius (or is it Cn. 3
,Cornelius ?)‚ a friend of yours, “ A man of highest
birth, a very son of earth.’' ⁰ Well, because he knows
1 am a friend of yours, he is constantly asking me to
dinner. So far he has not been able to induce me
to go; still I think it very kind of him.

CICERO To THE SAME

Rome, December, 54 mc.

, I have read your letter, from which 1 gather that 1
, our friend Caesar considers you an excellent lawyer.
3 You may well congratulate yourself on having
ξ reached those regions where you pass as a man of
ᾗ some legal ability ; had you got as far as Britain too,
ᾗ I am sure you would not have found a single man in
ἰ all that great island more of an expert than yourself.
