write you something that would tend to lessen your

CICERO TO THE SAME

Rome, May or June, 59 13.c.

Ι will attend to your commission with all care.‘¹
But, elever fellow that you are, you have entrusted
that commission to the very man of all others whose
interest it is that the property should fetch as high a
price as possible. But you showed remarkable fore·
sight in fixing beforehand a figure beyond which
Ι should not go. Had you only given me carte
blanche, such is my regard for you, Ι should have
come 'to some arrangement with my co-heirs. As it
is, now that Ι know the price you have fixed, Ι shall
put up a sham bidder sooner than let it go for less
than your limit. But my joke has gone far enough.
11¹? do the job for you, as I am bound to do it, with
a care.

I am quite sure that you are glad about Bursa? 2
but you are too modest in your congratulations,
evidently thinking, as indeed you write, that
because he was such a low scoundrel, Ι did· not

think it any great reason for being delighted.
