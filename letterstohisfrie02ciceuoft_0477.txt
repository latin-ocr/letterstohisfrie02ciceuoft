EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XI. vn.

Ι, from Graeceius,⁴² though indeed he lest only a few

minutoe after Seius.
But the main point is this—and 1 would have you 2

v grasp it and bear it in mind most carefully-—that in
> the matter of praeerving the liberty and welfare of
· the Roman people you are not to await the sanction of
, a Senate which is still enslaved, for by so doing you

would not only stultify your own action (it was by no
public authority, you know, that you freed the Re-
public, and that, of course, makes the achievement all
the more magnificent and illustrious)‚ but you would
also convict the youth, or rather the boy‚¹’ Oaaear, of

γ’ foolhardy anfion in having taken up so heavy a public

 

roeponsibility all on his own initiative ; and finally, you
would convict of insane folly men who, though
oounh’y-bred‚ are yet very gallant soldiers and very
excellent citizens—I mean, firstly, the veteram, your
own comrades-in-arms‚ and seconffly, the Martian
legion, and the Fourth, who declared their own
‚ consul a public enemy, and flung themselvae into
’ the defence of the public safety. When its formal
sanction is obstructed by intimidation, the wishes of
the Senate must be regarded as the equivalent of
such sanction.

Lastly, you have now chosen your side twice, so 3
that you have not a free hand ; first on the Ides of
.- March, and again, lately‚ by the enlistment of your
’ new army and forces. You ought, therefore,whatever
Α happens, to be so prepared and so minded as not
’ζ indeed to do nothing without orders, but to go on
2» achieving what will meet with universal praise and
’ζ the most genuine admiration.
