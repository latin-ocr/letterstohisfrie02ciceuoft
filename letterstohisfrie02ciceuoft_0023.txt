CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY

of Sestius encouraged Cicero to hope for the restora-
tion of the Republie, or at any rate the dissolution
of the eoalition, Pompey being still at feud with
Crassus (ἓ 2) and iealous of Caesar.

§4- Cicero therefore, partly with a view of widen-
ing the breach between Pompey and Caesar, pro-
posed the suspension of Caesar’s law about the
ager Campanus (see 59 B.C., ξ 1) on the grounds that
the State could not afford any more allotments.
This would not affect Pompey, whose veterans had
already been provided for, whereas Caesar would
be precluded from using the remaining land for his
own veterans. He also saw that the repeal of the
agrarian law would be followed by that of the
Vatinian.

§5- Having therefore previously interviewed
Crassus at Ravenna, Caesar took him with him to
join Pompey at Luca, a town of Liguria in N. Italy ς
and here the coalition of 60 (see 60 n.c.,§ 3) was
not only renewed but developed into an omnipotent
triumvirate who could settle the affairs of the State
at their own discretion.

§6- This to Cicero, the Repubhcan, and life-
long advocate of concordia ordinum (“ the harmony
of the senatorial and equestrian orders ”), was a
crushing political calamity, but he had to bow to the
inevitable‚ and the famous letter 9 in Bk. Ι. is his
apologia for his change of front. Withdrawing
his motion on the ager Campanus, he supported
a motion in the Senate to provide pay for Caesar's
troops and allowing him to appoint ten legati. This
was followed by his brilliant speech De provinciis
consularibus, practically a panegyric upon Caesar and
his achievements in Gaul.
