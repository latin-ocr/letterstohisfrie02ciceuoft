CICERO ΤΟ THE SAKE
Rome, late in March or early in April, 43 mc.

Ι What the state of affairs was when I sent you this 1
letter, you can find out from C. Titius Strabo:⁸ a man of
merit, a'nd excellently well disposed to the Republic—
Ι need not add most eager to join you, seeing that
he has lest his home and all that he possessoe‚ to
come to γοα rather than to anybody. So Ι do not so
much as recommend him to you. His having made
his way to you himself is recommendation enough.

Ι would have you consider and assure yourself2
that if anything untoward happens, which I should
deplore, the only refuge left for. honest citizens
is with you and Brutus. As I write thaee words,
matters have come to the final crisis3 for Brutus
is now barely able to hold his own at Mutina. If
he has come safe through it, we have triumphed;
if otherwise (Heaven avert the omen !) there is but
one direction in which we can all rush, and that is to
you? See to it, therefore, that you have all the
courage and au the resources needful to win back

. the Republie in its entirety. Farewell.
