CICERO ³

ego cum tabernariis et aquariis pugnarem, veternus ·
civitatem occupasset. Si Parthi vos m‘hil calfaciunt,
nos hic frigore frigescimus. Tamen, quoquo modo
potuit,1 sine Parthis Bibulus in Amano nescio quid
cohorticularum amisit. Hoc sic nuntiatum est.

5 Quod tibi supra scripsi, Curionem valde frigere3 iam
calet. Nam ferventissime concerpitur. Levissime
enim, quia de intercalando non obtinuerat, transfugit
ad populum et pro Caesare loqui coepit3 legemque

expedit. Turpe tibi erit, pantheras Graecas2 me
non habere.

of the public water-supply to be allowed to draw more than
their quantum for their rivate use, and Caelius as aedile
intervened to check the a use.

ὓ Curio as pontiff had failed to induce his colleagues to
intercalate a month in 50 1³.c.‚ which was necessary, as no
month had been intercalated in 51 1³.c. As the insertion
would have been made after February 23, it would have
postponed the debate on the consular provinces which
was arranged for March 1. Curio also wished to prolong

his own term of office.
