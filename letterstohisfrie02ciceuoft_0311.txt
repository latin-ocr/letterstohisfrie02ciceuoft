oetate of which he is joint-owner with his brother.

² This Μ. Fadius bitterly resented, and he suggested
= thathis brother (a bit of a fool) had been urged to go

to such lengths by Marcus’s own private enemies. So
now, as you love me, my dear Paetus, take the whole
busin& on your shoulders‚ and deliver Fadius from
his distress. We have need of your influence, of your
counsel‚ and even of your persona] kindness Do
not allow brothers to engage in litigation, and have

¹ their heads banged together in a discreditable law-

suit. Fadius has two enemies in Mato and Pollius*
Why say any more? 1 assure you I cannot fully
express in a letter how grateful I shall be to you if
you put Fadius at his ease. He thinks it all depends
upon you, and I believe him.
