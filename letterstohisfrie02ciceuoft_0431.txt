EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X. xm.

So had not a letter reached me by 333, Ι should be
in absolute ignorance of what was going 011 31 Rome.
But now that Ι have the opportunity, the 33111113
3333011 having 11331111, Ι shall write to you with the
greatest gusto, and as frequently as 1 can.

There is no danger of my being affected by the 2
talk of 3 111311, who (although nobody likoe the
sight of him)‘ is not as much hated by men in general
33 he doeervoe to be. So thoroughly do Ι 1131331 him
that I regard with disgust whatever Ι have to do in
conjunction with him. Now my own instincts and
pai-suits incline me to 1133113 peace and libert-53
31111 30 Ῑ have often bitterly bewailed that first step
m civil war. Seeing, however, that, because 1 had
powerfiss 3113111133 011 110111 311133, 11 was impossible
for me to be wholly 113111131, Ι fled from the camp ⁶ 111
· which Ῑ knew beyond doubt that I should not be safe
from the machinations of an enemy. ⁰ Forced to a
1133131011 1101 at all to my liking, lest I should fall
into the background,1 boldly and unhaeitatingly
faced the dangers it involved.

ἶ But as regards Caesar, ‘¹ because he treated me as 3
⁷ one of his oldest friends, though he never made my
.‘ acquaintance until he had reached the height of

² his fortune, my esteem for him was based 011 1113
(13311331 devotion and loyalty. What it was possible
for me to achieve on my own initiative, I performed
f} in such a way as to win the heartiest approval of
” every true patriot; what I did under orders, Ι 11111
·‚..„ at such a moment and in 311311 3 manner as to make

’ it evident that instructions had been issued to an
t ⁷ agent. The quite undeserved odium Ι
⁷, have incurred by 11113 conduct 13 enough to teach
‚- me the Joys of freedom 31111 1113 1113131131111333 of life
