EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. 1.

For that mischief' 111 the city was spreading‚ and daily
gaining such strength, that for my own part 1 began

todespair of the city and the city’ s tranquillity. But
sedition has been so well suppressed that it seems to
me we are likely to be safe for all time, at any rate
from that most degrading danger. Important things,
and there are many of them, remain to be done, but

they all rest with you three. However, let me dis-

cuss them ιιι due order. As things have gone so far,
it would seem that we have been delivered, not from
3 tyranny, but from a tyrant. For though we have
slain the tyr-ant, we still watch that tyrant's every
nod. Nay, not only that, but measures which he
himself would not carry through were he alive, we

approve, because we suppose that he contemplated
ς them. And indeed I see no end to that sort of thing 3

decrees are posted up, exemptions are granted, huge
sums of money are squandered, exiles are recalled,

ἵ sham dem-ees of the Senate are registered ⁰ ; so that

it is only that hatred we had of an abominable charac-
ter and our resentment at being slaves that we have
got rid of, while the constitution lies prostrate amid
all this confusion into which he plunged it.

It is for you three to clear away all these difficulties, 2
and not to imagine that you have already satisfied

the claims the Republic has upon you. It is true that
ξ you have given her more than I ever thought of
ἶ even praying for, but she is not content, and looks
ἦ for great things at your hands, to match the great-
ἑ ness of your hearts and services. So far she has
‘j avenged her injuries by the death through your
agency of a despot ; nothing could be more splendid.
‹ But what glories that she once enjoyed has
she recovered? Is it that she obeys him dead,
