 

EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, VIII. ix.

Curio 1135 made me a present of that same ten, and
another ten from Africa3 so you must not think that
lauded estates are the only gifts he knows how to
boe‘oow. ⁰ If you only remember to do so. and send
for some hunters from Cibyra, and also write 3 letter
of instructions to Pamphylia (for they tell me that
more of them are caught there), you will accomp lish
all you want. My anxiety on this point is allp the
greater now, because Ι expect that I shall have to
provide everything myself, quite apart from my
colleague. For love' s sake, lay this charge upon v our-
self. You are usually as fond of taking trouble, as I for
the most part am of taking none. In this matter you
will have no trouble except to say a few words—that
is, to give orders and instructions. For as soon as the
animals are caught, you have the men Ι sent to deal
with Sittius' 5 bond available to seed them and see to
their being shipped to Rome. I also think. that, if
you hold out any hopes to me in your letter, I shall
send some more men over to you.

There 1s one Marcus Feridius, a Roman knight the 4
son of a friend of mine, 3 young man of merit and
energy, who has arrived in your province on business
of his own ; Ι strongly commend him to you, and beg
you to put his name 011 your list of friends. He
desires that the lands which certain municipalities
hold 35 3 means of profit? should, by an act of kindness
as easy as it is honourable for you to perform, be
exempted from taxation. You will find you have
laid under an obligation to you men who are grateful
as well as good.

I should not like to think that Favoniuse was re- 5
jected by the corner· men ἅ only3 no, all the best men
refused to vote for him.
