EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. xxvx.

lived in my books ? But even with them, though Ι
am not exactly sick of them, there is a certain limit.
When Ι have left them, though I am very little con-

Dion—still 1 am unable to discover what better I can

great man asked if anybody had any question to put,
declat-ed that the one question in your head from
early mom was the question of dinner. The poor
old simpleton thought you would ask whether there
