how dear you are to me. And since we have both
got so far, it only remains for us to have a com-
petition in mutual good services3 and Ι shall not mind
in the least whether Ι beat you at that game, or you

from Volumnius the senator, with whom Ι am in
constant touch3 but as 1 read on, the graceful
budinage of the letter convinced me that it was from

which is there translated “ jesting.'’ Aristotle defines it as
πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις, “ educated insolence.''
