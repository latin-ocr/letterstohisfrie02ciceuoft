 

EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, Vll. xum-xxv.

Sestius! Ι replied that 1 could not possibly attend,
’ but that if he selected any other day he pleased, I
should not fail him. But conscious of the fact that
he had a grandson* who was quite a nice flautist, and
not a bad singer, he left me, as it seemed to me, in

· high dudgeon. There you are, a pair of Sardinians

for sale, one worse than the other. You now know
all about my case, and the unreasonable behaviour
of that coxcomb. Send me your Cato⁶; I want to

read it. That Ι have not yet done so is no aedit
to either of us.

CICERO ΤΟ THE sum

Tusculum, August, 45 mc.

You are sorry the letter ὅ has been torn up 3 well,
don't fret yourself; I have it ⁶ safe at home ; you
may oome and fetch it whenever you like. That you
should warn me at all, however, gives me great
pleasure3 and 1 beg you will never eease to do so.

’ You are evidently afraid that unless we have him t

 

with us, we may have to laugh ‘⁸ on the wrong side
of our mouths.’' But listen! Hands off your
tablet Ξ ⁰ The Dominio is here sooner than we
expected. Ι fear he will make Catachthonians of
us Catonians.»

You must never imagine, my dear Gallus, that 2
auything can beat that part of your letter begin-

Ι As we should say to a schoolboy, “Stop scribbling on

your slate.” It may also mean ‘⁴ stop writing about Catoss’

See note c on Ep. 24 above. The Dominie is Caesar, just
returned from Spain.

Β Or ‘⁶ send whoever stieks to Cato to the Styx.”
