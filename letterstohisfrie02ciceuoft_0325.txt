Rome, late in September, 44 nc.

In view of our close intimacy the eompliment ⁶ paid l
you would not have lacked my enthusiastic support,

Τ had 1 been able to attend the Senate either with

whose political opinions are in favour of liberty move

' with my dignity to express my feelings about the
, Republic in a place* where 1 should be heard

better and at closer quarters by armed men than

ζ, by senators.
