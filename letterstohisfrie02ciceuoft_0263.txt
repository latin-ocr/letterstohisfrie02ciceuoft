mmo το ι. PAPIRIUS marval·
Rome, middle of October, 46 n-c.

Ξ ” There are two letters of yours which Ι shall answer 1
; —one which Ι received four days ago from Zethus,⁶
ζ the other which was brought me by your letter-carrier
Phileros! The former of your letters gave me to
“ understand that you were very grateful for my
A, anxiety about your health‚—-an anxiety Ι am glad you
ἶ now thoroughly appreciate. But, believe me, no
” letter could have given you a perfectly true appreci-
”’ afion of it. For though I am aware that I am
·;. courted and made much of by quite a number of
f people (1 cannot deny it), not one of them all has a
, greater atu-action for me than yourself. For your
'' loving me, and having done so for many years past
⁸³ and uninterruptedly‚ is indeed a great, and perhaps
*fthe greatest possible, compliment‚ but there are
‘2 many others who do the same; whereas your being
2 yourself so lovable, so chax-ming, and in every
{respect so delightful—that is something exclusively
our own.

{y Resides, there is your wit, not Attic, but more 2
-r pungent than that of Attic writers—-the good old city
{wit of Rome. Now for me (you may think what you
'Splease of it) humour, and most of all the home·
}gmwn kind, has a wonderful fascination, especially
when Ι see that it was overlaid with the coarseness
