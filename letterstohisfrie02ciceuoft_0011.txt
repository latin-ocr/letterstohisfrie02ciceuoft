INTRODUCTION

Tine collection of Cicero’s “ Letters to his Friends '⁹
was preserved and edited by his secretary Tiro. The
collection is inadequately entitled, as it includes
several letters, some of them of profound interest,
from his friends to Cicero. There are 426 letters,
divided into sixteen books, not arranged in any
sort of order,⁰ chronological or otherwise, except
that letters from or to particular correspondents are
= generally grouped together ; the third book, for
instance, consists exclusively of letters from Cicero
to Appius Claudius Pulcher, and the eighth book of
letters from Marcus Caelius Rufus to Cicero.

’ The earliest letter is one from Cicero to Pompey
(x. 7) dated 62 B.C., the year after Cicero’s consul-
ship3 the latest is one from him to Cassius (xii. 10)
written in 43 13.c., the year after the assassination of
Caesar, and a few months before his own.

These nineteen years from 62 to 43 ιο. cover a
period of supreme importance in the history of the
Roman Republie—a period more minutely described
and vividly illustrated in these letters, giving us as
they do the different points of view of various corre-
spondents, than even in the “ Letters to Atticus,''
written by Cicero alone.

⁸ The confusion thus caused is to some extent obviated

by a summary, in chronological order, resured to each
volume, of the events in each year covered y the Letters3
