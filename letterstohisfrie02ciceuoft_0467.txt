’ξ ErisTULAE AD FAMILIARES, xl. 111.
t

you were so little able to control your anger as to
reproach us with the death of Caesar.

This much, however, we would have you consider 3
yourself—how far it is to be tolerated that praetors
should not be allowed in the interests of harmony
and liberty to waive by public announcement some
of their own rights without being threatened with
armed violence by the Consul. Your reliance on such
methods has no ten-ors for us ; for neither is it seemly

' or suitable for us, on our side, to bow our spirit
before any peril, nor is it for Antony to claim lordship
over those to whose efforts he owoe his freedom. As
for omselves, were we urged by other considerations
to wish to fan the flame of civil war, your letter would
have no effect whatever ; for the man who threatens
has no authority among free men. But you are per-

²³ fectly well aware that we are not to be driven either
this way or that, and it is quite likely that the motive

of your blustering is to give our prudence the appear-
ance of pauic.

Ἶ Our sentiments are these ε we are anxious that you 4
, should hold a high and honourable position in any
Ῐ constitution that is free, and we challenge you to no
‘ kind of hostility 3 but, for all that, we attach less value
ι “’ to your friendship than to our own liberty.

'a Consider again and again what you are under-
: taking, and what strength you have for it3 and be

’ , heaven that your counsels may conduce pto ythe
{L welfare of the State and of yourself3 failing that, our
’ prayer is that they may be as little harmful to your-

self as is consistent with the welfare and honour of
the Republic. Aug. 4th.
