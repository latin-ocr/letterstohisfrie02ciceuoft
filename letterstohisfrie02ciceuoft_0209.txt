 

EPISTULAE AD' FAMHAARES, vui. xv1.

of which, I beg to inform you, will on the arrival of
Caesar be ours. What hope your friends have left
ν them when they have lost the Spains‚ I know not3
and further, what your idea is in joining men so
desperately situated, I take my solemn oath, I cannot
conceive.

What you so clearly intimated tome by your very 4
silence had got to Caesar’s ears, and he had no sooner
wished me ‘⁴ good morning ” than he told me the
whole story of what he had heard about you. Ι said
1 knew nothing about it, but all the same I besought
him to write you such a letter as might be most likely
to frighten you into staying in Italy. He is taking
me with him into Spain; if he were not, I should
have hurried all· the way to join you, wh'erever you
were, before approaching the city, and urged you
personally to make me this promise, and exerted all
my powers to keep you from going away.

Think it over again and again, Cicero, so as not to 5
bring utter ruin upon yourself and your friends, or
knowingly and with your eyes open let yourself sink
into a morass, out of which, as you see, you can
never emerge.

But if you are either disturbed by the comments of
the Optimates, or unable to tolerate the swaggering
insolence of certain other fellows, my advice is that
you should select some suitable town unaffected by
the war, while these issues, which will be presently
settled, are being decided. If you do so. not only
shall 1 judge you to have acted wisely‚ but you will
avoid giving offence to Caesar.
