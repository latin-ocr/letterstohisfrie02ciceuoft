 

EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. n.

Neither Piso,⁶ therefore, who was the first to assail
him without finding anybody to back him up, nor I,
who did the same a month asterwards, nor P.
Servilius? who immediately followed uS, are allowed
to enter the Senate with safety. For the swordsman
is bent on bloodshed, and imagined that he would
make a beginning of it with me on the 19th of
September, on which day he had turned up ready
primed, after studying his speech for several days
at the villa of Metellus.⁶ But, Ι ask you, what sort
of study was possible amid scenes of debauchery and
drunkenness? So, as I wrote to you before, the
universal impression was that (as is his habit), he
spewed rather than spoke his speech.

As to your writing therefore that you are sure 2
some good can be done by my influence and eloquenee,
well, considering how great are our troubles, some
good has been done. It has been brought home to
the people of Rome that there are three eir-consuls?
who, because they have been patriotic towards the
Republic, and have spoken freely, cannot enter
the Senate with safety. Nor is there any reason
for your expecting any-thing beyond this, since
your relative ⁶ is delighted with his new marriage-
connexion, so he no longer takes any very keen
interest in the games, and is bursting with jealousy
at the boundless applause given to your brother!
A second relative of yours⁹ also has found soothing
v syrup in Caesar's fiesh memoranda. All this, how-
J, ever, one can put up with; what is not endurable is
y ᾗ that a man can be found to think that his son will be
ξ consul in the year that belongs to you and Brutus,

’ L. Aemilius Paullus, or C. Marcellus ς and Bardt makoe out
ξ a good case for L. Marcius Philippus, consul in 56.
