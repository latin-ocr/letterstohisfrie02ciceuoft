EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X. xxm.

tinguishing the war ; Ι condemned the parleys ⁰
that had taken plaee; I had forbidden the legates ⁶
sent under the guarantee of Lepidus to come within

“ you at Rome do not fail us, Ι assure you that, for my
own part, Ι shall amply satisfy the claims of the
Republic in every particular.

As for you, my dear Cicero, I asseverate that my 7
love for you increases day by day ; and your kind ser-
vices daily intensify my anxiety not to forfeit an atom
of either your love or your esteem. I pray that I may

’ soon be at your side, and so be permitted, by the

 

dutiful discharge of my obligations to you, to enhance
the pleasure you take in doing kindnesses to me.
