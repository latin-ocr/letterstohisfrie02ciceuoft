CICERO

Camp in Gaul, J uly 28th, 43 mc.

It is impossible for me not to express my gratitude 1
to you in regard to every detail of your services.
But I assure you that 1 do so with a sense of shame.
For neither does the intimate connexion you have
encouraged between us appear to require any
expression of thanks, nor is it any pleasure to me
to repay your wonderful kindness by employing the
cheap currency of words⁰; and I had rather prove
to you that Ι am not forgetful by my respecfful
consideration for' you, and unfailing attention to
you when we meet. But if life be spared me,
by that same respectful consideration and unfailing
attention Ι shall outdo all the gratitude of your
friends, and even an the affection of your kinsfolk.
As for your love and esteem for me, I find it hard to
tell whether it is likely to bring me in greater
measure permanent honour or daily delight.

You have been concerned about the benefactions 2
to the soldiers ; it was not with a view to my own
personal ascendancy (I am sure Ι harbour no sinister
design) that Ι wished them to be honoured by the
Semte, but because in the first place I considered
they deserved it; in the next place, because I
desired them to be more closely bound to the
Republic to meet any possible emergency ; and
lastly, so that I might keep them proof against any
temptation from any quai-ter and guarantee their
being as loyal to you as they have been hitherto.⁶
