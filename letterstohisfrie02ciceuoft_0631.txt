also Ῑ prefer that you should learn from others.

My very dear friend T. Pinarius⁶ Ι cannot com· 3
mend to you more enthusiastically than I do ; Ι am
on the most friendly terms with him, as much for all
his admirable qualitiae, as for the tastes we have in
common„ He is now agent in charge of the accounts
and business transactions of our friend Dionysius,¹’
whom you love much, and I love more than anybody.
It should not be necessary for me to make this
recommendation to you, but I make it all the same.
You will, therefore, 1 am sure, see to it that the
letters of that most grateful of men, Pinarius, con-
vince me of your devotion, both to himself and to
Dionysius.

Rome, about March 20th, 43 mc.

It was on the Liberalia ⁶ that Ι received your letter l
which young Cornificius delivered to me, as he told
me, on the 22nd day. There was no Senate on that
or the following day. During the Quinquatria‘³ I
pleaded your cause before a full house, not without
the blessing of Minerva. It was on that very day in
fact that the Senate decreed the restoration of my
statue of Minerva ⁶ which had been thrown down by
a hurricane. Pansa read out your despatch. The
Senate immediately signified its warm approval, to
my great delight and the disgust of the Minoum, to

⁶ A statue of Minerva set up in the Capitol by Cicero just
before he was exiled.
