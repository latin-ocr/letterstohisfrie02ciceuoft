EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. ιιι-ιν.

severity of the disease forces upon us the need for
medicine, and that medicine now reveals itself,
though we pereeived not its virtue when we were well.

But why do I preach these doctrines now, and to
you too, at whose home they are born—sending “ an
owl to Athens ⁰ ? ” For no reason, of course, but to
make you write something in reply, and look forward
to my coming ; and that 1 am sure you will do.

About things possibk you must know that I judge
according to Diodorus.¹> And therefore if you are
about to come, you must know that your coming
is nooessavy; if you are not, then your coming is
impossible. Now then consider which judgment
gives you the greater pleasure, that of Chrysippus⁶
or this one, which was too much for the digestion of
our teacher Diodotus.‘²¹ But of these matters too we
shall talk when we are at leisure3 for this also is
possible according to Chrysippus. I am obliged
to you about Cocceius3 for 1 had given that com-
? mission to Atticus also. If you fail to come to me,
⁴ 1 shall hasten to you. If you have a garden in
your library, we shall have all we want.⁶
