CICERO ΤΟ mancus
Rome, middle of December, 44 ιο.

Ῑ have received two letters from you, each the 1
exact copy of the other, and this in itself I regarded
as a proof of your affectionate care; for Ι saw
clearly that you were making every effort to have
your most anxiously awaited letter safely delivered
to me. It gave me a double satisfaction, which
made it difficult for me to decide upon comparison,
whether I should attach the greater value to your
affection for me, or to your feelings towards the
Republic. Speaking generally, in my judgment,
the love of one’s country is paramonnt, but persona}
love and community of aspirations certainly carry
with them a greater charm. And so your reminding
me of my close intimacy with your father, and of
that friendlinoes you had displayed towards me from
your boyhood, and of everything else connected with
that sentiment, brought me a joy beyond belief.

Again the declaration of the feelings you enter· 2
tained‚ and would continue to entertain, as regards
the RepubHc, gave me‘ the greatest pleasure, and
my joy was all the more intense because it came as an

2 addition to what you had previously said. And so
¹ 1 not only exhort you, my dear Plancus, but I even

implore you in all earnaetnoes (as 1 did in the letter
to which you repliedin such very courteous tel-ms),
