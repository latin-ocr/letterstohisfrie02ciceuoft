EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. 1V.-v.

some command of sarcasm for being' m such a hurty
to take your place, though you had hardly been a
month’ m Syria⁶ ; so that it was obvious to all that he
had no right to be admitted into the province. Both
you and Brutus are the subject of the highest en-

comiums, for having (as is believed) exceeded all
expectations in getting together an army. Ι should
write at greater length if I knew the circumstances
of the case. As it is, what I write is only based on
general opinion and hearsay. Ι am greedily awaiting

a letter from you.

CICERO ¹1⁸0 'nu-2 SAME
Rome, late in February, 43 mc.

Ι suppose it is the wintry weather that has hitherto 1
prevented us from having any certain information
about you—what you are doing, and most im-
portant of all, where you are. What everybody is
9 saying however, 1 suppose because they wish it,1² is
that you are in Syria, and in command of forces.
This is all the more readily believed because it seems
so likely to be true. Our friend M. Brutus indeed
has won extraordinary distinction ; his achievements
have been so substantial and so unexpected, that
welcome as they are in themselves, their brilliancy
has been enhanced by their rapid succession. Now
. if you also hold in your hand all we believe you do,
the props that support the Republic are strong ; since
from the nearest point of Greece right up to Egypt
we shall find security in governments and armies
commanded by citizens of the highaet loyalty.
