CICERO '1'0 THE snm
Rome, May 5th, 43 mc.

What a delightful report we heard two days 1
before the victory about the reinforcements you
were bringing up, your enthuffiasm, your rapidity,
your forcae! And yet even now that the enemy
has been routed, all our hope lies in you. For it is
said that the most notorious ringleaders of those
brigands have escaped from the battle of Mutina.
But finally to destroy a foe wins no less gratitude
than to repulse his first attack.

For my own part, I am eagerly awaiting your 2
despatch, and many others are doing so too ; and I
hope also that Lepidus will take warning from the
present state of affairs and co-operate with you and
the Republic. Therefore, my dear Plancus, regard
it as an urgent charge upon you to leave alight no
, single spark of this most hideous war. If this be
done, you will have bestowed a higher than human
blessing upon the State, and will yourself win ever·

Ἴ lasting glory. May 5th.
