meula, end of April, 45 mc.

Ι could wish that your missing a letter from me were 1
due to my own death rather than to the calamity ⁰
which has crushed me with its overwhehning weight
—u calamity 1 should bear more calmly, if Ι had you
here3 for your wise words, and your exceptional
affection for me too, would go far to alleviate my
sorrow. But since 1 am going to see you, as I sup-
pose, before long, you will find me in such a state of
mind that Ι may easily derive much benefit from
your oompany3 not that Ι am so broken as either
to have forgotten that I am but a mortal, or to think
it right to bow beneath the blows of Fortune3
but anyhow Ι have been robbed of every particle of
that attractive vivacity of mine which used to delight
you more than anybody else. For al] that, you will
discover my strength of mind and resolution (if Ι ever
possessed those virmae) to be just the same as when
you left me.

You write that you are taking up the cudgels on 2

” my behalf3 ⁶ well, Ι am not so anxious that my tra-

ducers should be confuted by you, as I am desirous
that it should be understood—and surely it is under-
stood—that you continue to love me. I beg you

⁰ and again to do so, and to pardon so brief
a letter3 for not only shall we meet, Ι fancy, very
soon, but Ι am not yet sufficiently recovered to write

ἱ letters.
