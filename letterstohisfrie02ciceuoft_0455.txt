’ Ems'rULAE AD FAMILIARES, x xxxv.

Ι should shortly have proved to you, had not the
development of my own special poliey been wrenched
out of my hands by fortune. For my army, rising
v in mutiny as one man, held to its traditional custom
in preserving the lives of its fellow-citizens and the
peace of the eommunsty, and, to speak the truth,
r compellati me to undertake the support of so vast a
. number of Roman citizens in their claims to life and
civil ' hts.

Anrdgin this matter, I pray and beseech you, 2
ffiffissttssfflffies? isssslreswtsdssf ἷιῖῗὲἱίιξῗῗέὲ ῗῖἑῗ
to set down as a crime the mercy shown by my self
⁷ and my army at a time of civil discord. If you decide
’ to consider the safety and political standing of all
. parties, you wil] better promote your own interests,
· as well as those of the State. Pons ArgenteuS,

ῃ May soth.
