EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XII. 11.—1n.

and'for that reason makes a parade of being our
brigand's very humble servant.

As for my dear friend L. Cotta}¹ yielding to a sort 3
of irresistible despair (his own expression) he attends
the Senate less regularly ; L. Caesar-,⁶ most admirable
and gallant of citizens, is prevented by ill-health3
Servius Sulpicius‚⁶ a man of the greatest influence
and soundaet senfiments, is away from Rome. As
for the raet, with the exception of the consuls-
designate! you must pardon me if I refuse to reckon
them as consulars.

There you have the leaders of public policy3 it
would be an insignificant number, even if all were
going well ; what do you think of it in thaee days of
despair? That is why our every hope lies in you ‘3
and if your only object in keeping away is to be in
a safe place, there is no hope even in you. If, how-
ever, you are meditating some scheme worthy of your
glory, 1 should like to see it carried through while
I am yet alive. But if that is not to be, none

again through your agency. For myself, I never fail,
and I never shall fail, to protect those dear to you ;
and whether they appeal to me for advice or whether
they don't, 1 can in either case guarantee my love
and loyalty to yourself. Farewell.
