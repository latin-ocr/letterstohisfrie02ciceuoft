EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, X. mun-mna

Antony time to oetablish himself. The season of
the year, moreover‚ gives me more freedom of
action, owing to the fact that corn is either stacked
on the fields or in the farm-granaries. So 1 shall

give you a full explanation of my plans in my next

,letter 3 you may be sure 1 have no wish either to fail

the Republic or to survive it. What annoys me most,
however, is that I can only be reached by a route so

’ long and dangerous, that no news oomoe in before
“ the fortieth day after the event, or even later.

Pons Argenteus· about May 18th, 43 mc.
Ifyou are well, all is right ; Ι too am well. When l

ἕ 1 heard that Antony, having sent L. Antonius

ahead with part of his cavalry, was entering my

. province with his forcoe, Ι moved with my own
- army from the confluence of the Rhone ⁶ and
² determined to march against them. And so, by a
⁷ rapid suecession of marehes, I arrived at Forum
1: Voconii, and encamped beyond that town on the
ἦ river Argenteus, opposite the Antonians. P. Ven-
ε tidius ⁶ has joined him with his own three legions,
ζ and pitched his camp even further beyond the town
j than I have. Before that, Antony had the Second
ᾳ legion and a large number of men drawn from the
other legionS, but unarmed. He has a large force
of cavalry, for it an left the battle unscathed‚ so
ἶζ that there are more than five thousand horse.
