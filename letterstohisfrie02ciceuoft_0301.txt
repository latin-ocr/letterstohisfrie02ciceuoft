 

EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, IX. xxu.

unexceptionable meaning. Come τιον, is not divisio ⁶
an unexceptionable word ? But there is an obscenity
in it, and &lampedo ⁰ is on all fours with it. Are these
words therefore obscene? It is ridiculous in us, how-

« ever, not to preface the remark ‘⁸ he siz-angled his

father” with,“ if you will pardon the expressions& and
yet be obliged to do so if it has any refere'nce to
an Aurelia or a Lollia! And indeed it has come
to this, that we even use words that are not obscene
in an obscene sense. Baauit, says he, is a shameless
word, clepsit much more so.‘² And yet neither is in
itself obscene. Testis, a most decent word in a court
of law, is not over-decent elsewhere. And while colei
Lanuvini is all right, Cliternini is not so.⁶ Why, the
thing itself can be at one moment decent, at another
indecent. Suppeditf is grossly coarse; presently a
man will be naked in his bath, and you will have no
word of reproof. Here is your Stoic disquisition in a
nutshell ε “ The wise man will call a spade a spade.”

ἶ What a lot of talk arising from a single word of yours ! 5

1 am gratified that, in arguing with me, there is no

word you dare not use. As for me, I maintain, and

ever shall maintain‚ as has always been my habit,
the modest roeerve of Plato ; so Ι have used veiled
language in writing to you of what the Stoics deal
with in the most outspoken way. But they—why,
they go so far as to say that crepitus should be just as
free as udus ! All honour therefore to the Calends
of March! You will, I am sure, continue to love

me and to keep well.
