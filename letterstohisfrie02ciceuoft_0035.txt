EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, v11. 1.

j of yours, from which, by maln’ng a gap,⁴⁸ you have
3 opened out for yourself a view of the Stabian stage,
ἔ have spent the morning hom-s of all those days in
taln'ng peeps at the scenery‚⁶ while they meantime,

who lest you where you are, were gazing at 1:2ch

’ ’ the public stage‚—and could scarcely keep awake.

The remaining hours of the day, however, you have

“ been spending in such amusements as you had

provided for yourself according to your fancy, while

ἴ we had to go through with anything that Sp. Maecius ⁶

-just think of it !—had sanctioned.

If you ask me, the games were of course most
magnificent 3 but they would not have been to your
taste 3 that Ι infer from my own feelings. For in the
first place those actors had returned to the stage out
of roepect for the occasion,‘² who had, as I thought,
quitted it out of self-respect. Indeed your favourite,

our friend Aesop,⁶ was such a failure that nobody in

the world would have regretted his leaving off. When
he began to swear the oath, his voice failed him at the
crucial point, If wittingly I deceive. Why should I
tell you anything more? You know what the rest
of the games were like. Why, they were not even as
attractive as games on a middling scale often are.
For any feeling of cheerfulnoes was extinguished by
the spectacle of such magnificenee—a·magnificence
which, I am sure, it will not disturb you in the least
to have missed seeing. For what pleasure can there
be in the sight of six hundred mules in the Clytaem-
nestra, or of three thousand bowls in the Trcy‘an
Hor-se, or of the varied accoutrements of foot and

great comedian. Cicero calls him “summus artifex.”
