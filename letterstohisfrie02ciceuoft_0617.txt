please even Caesar himself. For the issuoe of civil

*wishes that are carried out, but those also have to be
humoured by whose assistance the victory was won.
As for myself, Ι have become so thick-skinned, that
at our friend Caesar's games ⁰ I cast an eye upon
T. Plancus ὓ and listened to the poetry of Laberius and
Publilius ⁶ without turning a hair. I assure you Ι
need nothing so much as somebody to join me in
chuckling over all this with an understanding wink.
You are the very man, if only you come as soon as
possible ; and Ι think it as much to your interest as
my own that you should do so.

CICERO ΤΟ ΤΗΣ SAME

Rome, month uncertain, 46 or 45 mc.

Ι read your letter with the greatest pleasure31
what delighted me most in it was the information that
you had received mine ; Ι never doubted your reading
it with pleasure, but I was afraid of its not being
delivered. Your letter informs me that Caesar has

’ made you responsible for the war in Syria, and the

province of Syria itself. It is my desire that the
same should turn out well and fortunately for you,
and 1 am confident it will do so, having complete
saith in your energy and sagacity.

I am much troubled, however, by what you write as 2
to your apprehension of a Parthian war. For what
you had in the way of forces, Ι was both able to
conjecture and was directly informed in your letter.
